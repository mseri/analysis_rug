(** ** Continuity at a point *)

(** Theorem 9.1: the squaring function [x ↦ x²] is continuous at every point [c].

    Proof idea: use the ε–δ definition. The factorization
    [|x² - c²| = |x - c| · |x + c|] is key. If [|x - c| < 1] then
    [|x + c| = |(x - c) + 2c| ≤ |x - c| + 2|c| < 1 + 2|c|]. Taking
    [δ = min(1, ε / (2|c| + 1))] ensures [|x² - c²| < ε]. *)
(** The identity function has limit [c] at every point [c]. *)
Lemma id_limit (c : ℝ) :
    _limit_ of (fun x => x) in c is c.
Proof.
  We need to show that
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x ∈ ℝ, 0 < |x - c| < δ ⇒ |x - c| < ε.
  Take ε > 0.
  Choose δ := ε. { Indeed, ε > 0. }
  We need to show that ∀ x ∈ ℝ, 0 < |x - c| < δ ⇒ |x - c| < ε.
  Take x ∈ ℝ. Assume that 0 < |x - c| < δ as (Hx).
  We conclude that |x - c| < ε.

Lemma sq_continuous (c : ℝ) :
    _limit_ of (fun x => x * x) in c is (c * c).
Proof.
  By id_limit it holds that _limit_ of (fun x => x) in c is c as (Hid).
  By lim_product it holds that
    _limit_ of (fun x => x * x) in c is (c * c) as (Hsq).
  We conclude that _limit_ of (fun x => x * x) in c is (c * c).

(** Composition of continuous functions is continuous. *)
Lemma continuous_composition (g : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a < b)
    (Hg : ∀ x ∈ (fun x => a < x < b), continuity_pt g x) :
    ∀ x ∈ (fun x => a < x < b), continuity_pt g x.
Proof.

(** A Lipschitz function is continuous. *)
Lemma lipschitz_is_continuous (h : ℝ → ℝ) (x y : ℝ) (M : ℝ)
    (HM : ∀ s ∈ ℝ, ∀ t ∈ ℝ, Rabs (h s - h t) ≤ M * Rabs (s - t)) :
    continuity h.
Proof.
  (* A plain (non subset-typed) restatement of the Lipschitz estimate. *)
  We claim that ∀ s : ℝ, ∀ t : ℝ, Rabs (h s - h t) ≤ M * Rabs (s - t) as (HM').
  {
    Take s : ℝ. Take t : ℝ.
    By HM we conclude that Rabs (h s - h t) ≤ M * Rabs (s - t).
  }
  (* [Rmax M 1] guards against a nonpositive Lipschitz constant, and δ = ε/max(M,1). *)
  By Rmax_r it holds that 1 ≤ Rmax M 1 as (Hr).
  It holds that 0 < Rmax M 1 as (HMpos).
  By Rinv_0_lt_compat it holds that 0 < / Rmax M 1 as (Hinv).
  By Rinv_r it holds that Rmax M 1 * / Rmax M 1 = 1 as (Hri).
  (* [continuity_pt] is Stdlib's metric-space [limit1_in]; spelled out, the
     condition on the point is [D_x no_cond z w]. *)
  We need to show that ∀ z : ℝ, continuity_pt h z.
  Take z : ℝ.
  We need to show that ∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → ∃ alp : ℝ, alp > 0 ∧ (∀ w : ℝ,
    (no_cond w ∧ z ≠ w) ∧ Rabs (w - z) < alp → Rabs (h w - h z) < ε).
  Take ε : ℝ.
  Assume that ε > 0 as (Heps).
  It holds that ε / Rmax M 1 > 0 as (Hdpos).
  Choose alp := (ε / Rmax M 1).
  We show both statements.
  - We conclude that ε / Rmax M 1 > 0.
  - We need to show that ∀ w : ℝ,
      (no_cond w ∧ z ≠ w) ∧ Rabs (w - z) < ε / Rmax M 1 → Rabs (h w - h z) < ε.
    Take w : ℝ.
    Assume that
      (no_cond w ∧ z ≠ w) ∧ Rabs (w - z) < ε / Rmax M 1 as (Hw).
    It holds that Rabs (w - z) < ε / Rmax M 1 as (Hd).
    By HM' it holds that Rabs (h w - h z) ≤ M * Rabs (w - z) as (H1).
    By Rabs_pos it holds that 0 ≤ Rabs (w - z) as (H2).
    By Rmax_l it holds that M ≤ Rmax M 1 as (H3).
    It holds that Rabs (h w - h z) ≤ Rmax M 1 * Rabs (w - z) as (H4).
    It holds that Rmax M 1 * (ε / Rmax M 1) = ε as (H6).
    It holds that
      Rmax M 1 * Rabs (w - z) < Rmax M 1 * (ε / Rmax M 1) as (H7).
    We conclude that Rabs (h w - h z) < ε.

(** Continuous image of a compact set is compact. *)
Lemma continuous_image_compact (phi : ℝ → ℝ) (X : ℝ → Prop)
    (HX : X is _compact_)
    (Hphi : ∀ x ∈ X, continuity_pt phi x) :
    (fun y => ∃ x ∈ X, y = phi x) is _compact_.
Proof.
  (* Stdlib's [continuity_compact] needs continuity of [phi] on all of ℝ and
     concludes about [image_dir]; bridging it to the Waterproof [is _compact_]
     (sequential) notion and to this image set is the missing step. *)
  Admitted.

(** ** Sequential characterization of continuity *)

(** Continuity of [f] at [c] is the ε–δ statement
    [∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - c| < δ ⇒ |f(x) - f(c)| < ε], which in the
    Stdlib is [continuity_pt f c]. *)

(** *Sequential criterion for continuity*: [f] is continuous at [c] iff for
    every sequence [xₙ → c] one has [f(xₙ) → f(c)].

    Proof idea: (⇒) given [ε], continuity yields [δ]; convergence of [xₙ] puts
    the tail within [δ], hence [f(xₙ)] within [ε]. (⇐) contrapositive: a failure
    of continuity produces, taking [δ = 1/n], a sequence [xₙ → c] with
    [|f(xₙ) - f(c)|] bounded below. *)
(** The forward ("only if") half, which is Stdlib's [continuity_seq] bridged
    across [converges_to] / [Un_cv]. *)
Lemma continuity_imp_seq (f1 : ℝ → ℝ) (c : ℝ) (Hf : continuity_pt f1 c) :
    ∀ a : ℕ → ℝ, a ⟶ c → (fun n => f1 (a n)) ⟶ (f1 c).
Proof.
  Take a : (ℕ → ℝ).
  Assume that a ⟶ c as (Ha).
  By convergence_equivalence it holds that (a ⟶ c ⇔ Un_cv a c) as (H1).
  By H1 it holds that Un_cv a c as (Hcv).
  By (continuity_seq f1 a c Hf Hcv) it holds that
    Un_cv (fun i => f1 (a i)) (f1 c) as (H2).
  By convergence_equivalence it holds that
    ((fun n => f1 (a n)) ⟶ (f1 c) ⇔ Un_cv (fun n => f1 (a n)) (f1 c)) as (H3).
  By H3 we conclude that (fun n => f1 (a n)) ⟶ (f1 c).
Qed.

Lemma continuity_sequential_characterization (f : ℝ → ℝ) (c : ℝ) :
    continuity_pt f c ⇔
    (∀ a : ℕ → ℝ, a ⟶ c → (fun n => f (a n)) ⟶ (f c)).
Proof.
  (* The forward direction is [continuity_imp_seq] above. The backward direction
     builds, from a failure of continuity, a sequence picking for each [n] a
     point witnessing the failure at [δ = 1/n]; this needs countable choice,
     which is not available here (cf. [sequential_limit_characterization] in
     [Analysis.Limits]). Left admitted. *)
  Admitted.

(** *Algebraic continuity theorem*: sums, products, scalar multiples and (where
    the denominator is nonzero) quotients of functions continuous at [c] are
    continuous at [c].

    Proof idea: immediate from the algebraic limit theorem for functional
    limits, or from the sequential criterion together with the algebraic limit
    theorem for sequences. *)
(** [f] is renamed [f1]: a bare [f] in Waterproof/tactic scope resolves to the
    global [Stdlib.Reals.Rtopology.f] (a [family]) rather than the local binder. *)
Lemma algebraic_continuity_theorem (f1 g : ℝ → ℝ) (c k : ℝ)
    (Hf : continuity_pt f1 c) (Hg : continuity_pt g c) :
    continuity_pt (fun x => f1 x + g x) c ∧
    continuity_pt (fun x => f1 x * g x) c ∧
    continuity_pt (fun x => k * f1 x) c.
Proof.
  (* Stdlib algebraic continuity lemmas; [plus_fct]/[mult_fct]/[mult_real_fct]
     are definitionally the pointwise functions used in the goal. *)
  By (continuity_pt_plus f1 g c Hf Hg) it holds that
    continuity_pt (fun x => f1 x + g x) c as (H1).
  By (continuity_pt_mult f1 g c Hf Hg) it holds that
    continuity_pt (fun x => f1 x * g x) c as (H2).
  By (continuity_pt_scal f1 k c Hf) it holds that
    continuity_pt (fun x => k * f1 x) c as (H3).
  We conclude that
    (continuity_pt (fun x => f1 x + g x) c ∧
     continuity_pt (fun x => f1 x * g x) c ∧
     continuity_pt (fun x => k * f1 x) c).

(** ** Pathologies: the Dirichlet and Thomae functions *)

(** A real number is *rational* if it can be written [p/q] with [q ≠ 0]. *)
Definition is_rational (x : ℝ) : Prop :=
    ∃ p : Z, ∃ q : Z, (q <> 0)%Z ∧ x = IZR p / IZR q.

(** The *Dirichlet function* is [𝟙_ℚ]: it equals [1] at rationals and [0] at
    irrationals. (Defined classically, using the decidability oracle
    [excluded_middle_informative].) *)
Definition dirichlet_function (x : ℝ) : ℝ :=
    if excluded_middle_informative (is_rational x) then 1 else 0.

(** The Dirichlet function is continuous at *no* point.

    Proof idea: every neighbourhood of any [c] contains both a rational and an
    irrational (density of [ℚ] and of the irrationals), so [f] takes both
    values [0] and [1] arbitrarily close to [c] and cannot have a limit. *)
Lemma dirichlet_nowhere_continuous :
    ∀ c : ℝ, ¬ continuity_pt dirichlet_function c.
Proof.
  (* Needs density of ℚ and of the irrationals in ℝ, neither of which is
     available in the Stdlib [Reals] development in usable form. *)
  Admitted.

(** *Thomae's function* [t] (the "popcorn function") vanishes at every
    irrational, satisfies [t(0) = 1], and equals [1/q] at a rational [p/q] in
    lowest terms. We characterize it by its defining values. *)

(** Thomae's function is continuous at every irrational point.

    Proof idea: fix an irrational [c] and [ε > 0]. Only finitely many rationals
    in a bounded neighbourhood have denominator [q ≤ 1/ε], so [c] has a
    neighbourhood on which [t < ε]; since [t(c) = 0], this is continuity. *)
Lemma thomae_continuous_at_irrationals (t : ℝ → ℝ)
    (Hirr : ∀ x : ℝ, ¬ is_rational x → t x = 0)
    (Hpos : ∀ x : ℝ, is_rational x → t x > 0)
    (Hsmall : ∀ ε > 0, ∀ M : ℝ, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x : ℝ,
        Rabs (x - M) < δ → is_rational x → t x < ε ∨ t x = t M) :
    ∀ c : ℝ, ¬ is_rational c → continuity_pt t c.
Proof.
  (* Requires the finiteness of the set of rationals with bounded denominator
     in a bounded interval; not available from the Stdlib [Reals]. *)
  Admitted.

(** Thomae's function is discontinuous at every rational point.

    Proof idea: at a rational [c], [t(c) > 0], but every neighbourhood contains
    irrationals where [t = 0], so [t] cannot be continuous at [c]. *)
Lemma thomae_discontinuous_at_rationals (t : ℝ → ℝ)
    (Hirr : ∀ x : ℝ, ¬ is_rational x → t x = 0)
    (Hpos : ∀ x : ℝ, is_rational x → t x > 0) :
    ∀ c : ℝ, is_rational c → ¬ continuity_pt t c.
Proof.
  (* Requires density of the irrationals, same blocker as
     [dirichlet_nowhere_continuous]. *)
  Admitted.

(** ** Extreme value theorem *)

(** Theorem 9.2 (extreme value theorem): a continuous function on a closed
    interval [[a,b]] attains its maximum.

    Proof idea: the image [f([a,b])] is compact, as the continuous image of the
    compact set [[a,b]]. By the definition of compactness the supremum of the
    image is attained at some point in the image, giving a point where the
    maximum is achieved. *)
(* [f] is renamed to [f1] throughout: a bare [f] in a Waterproof statement
   resolves to [Stdlib.Reals.Rtopology.f], a [family]. *)
Theorem extreme_value_theorem (f1 : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a ≤ b)
    (Hf : ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → continuity_pt f1 x) :
    ∃ c, a ≤ c ∧ c ≤ b ∧ ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → f1 x ≤ f1 c.
Proof.
  (* [continuity_ab_maj] is the Stdlib form of the extreme value theorem. *)
  By (continuity_ab_maj f1 a b Hab Hf) it holds that
    ∃ Mx : ℝ, (∀ x : ℝ, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b ⇒ f1 x ≤ f1 Mx) ∧ a ≤ Mx ∧ Mx ≤ b as (Hmax).
  Obtain such a Mx.
  It holds that (∀ x : ℝ, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b ⇒ f1 x ≤ f1 Mx) as (H1).
  It holds that a ≤ Mx ∧ Mx ≤ b as (H2).
  Choose c := Mx.
  We conclude that
    (a ≤ Mx ∧ Mx ≤ b ∧ ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → f1 x ≤ f1 Mx).

(** A continuous function on a closed interval attains its minimum. *)
Theorem extreme_value_theorem_min (f1 : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a ≤ b)
    (Hf : ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → continuity_pt f1 x) :
    ∃ c, a ≤ c ∧ c ≤ b ∧ ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → f1 c ≤ f1 x.
Proof.
  By (continuity_ab_min f1 a b Hab Hf) it holds that
    ∃ mx : ℝ, (∀ x : ℝ, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b ⇒ f1 mx ≤ f1 x) ∧ a ≤ mx ∧ mx ≤ b as (Hmin).
  Obtain such a mx.
  It holds that (∀ x : ℝ, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b ⇒ f1 mx ≤ f1 x) as (H1).
  It holds that a ≤ mx ∧ mx ≤ b as (H2).
  Choose c := mx.
  We conclude that
    (a ≤ mx ∧ mx ≤ b ∧ ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → f1 mx ≤ f1 x).
Qed.

(** ** Intermediate value theorem *)

(** Theorem 9.3 (intermediate value theorem): if [f] is continuous on [[a,b]]
    and [f(a) < v < f(b)], then there exists [c ∈ (a,b)] with [f(c) = v].

    Proof idea: the bisection method constructs nested intervals
    [Iₙ = [aₙ, bₙ]] with [f(aₙ) < v] and [f(bₙ) ≥ v]. The nested interval
    property yields a point [c] in all intervals. Continuity gives
    [f(c) = limₙ f(aₙ) = limₙ f(bₙ)], and the order limit theorem forces
    [f(c) ≤ v] and [f(c) ≥ v], so [f(c) = v]. *)
Theorem intermediate_value_theorem (f1 : ℝ → ℝ) (a b v : ℝ)
    (Hab : a < b)
    (Hf  : ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → continuity_pt f1 x)
    (Hfa : f1 a < v) (Hfb : v < f1 b) :

Proof.
  (* Apply the Stdlib bisection form [IVT_interv] to [x ↦ f1 x - v]. *)

    By Hf it holds that continuity_pt f1 x as (Hc).
    We claim that constant (fct_cte v) as (Hcst).
    {

(** ** Uniform continuity *)

(** Theorem 9.4 (Heine's theorem): a continuous function on a compact set is
    uniformly continuous.

    Proof idea: for each point [c] of the set, continuity gives a neighborhood
    on which [f] varies by less than [ε/2]. These neighborhoods form an open
    cover; by compactness a finite subcover exists, and the minimum of the
    corresponding radii provides a uniform [δ]. *)

  By (Heine f1 (fun c : ℝ => a ≤ c ∧ c ≤ b) Hcomp Hcont) it holds that
    uniform_continuity f1 (fun c : ℝ => a ≤ c ∧ c ≤ b) as (Hu).
  (* [uniform_continuity] quantifies over [posreal]s, so ε and δ have to be
