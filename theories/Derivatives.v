(** ** Fermat's theorem *)

(** If [h] is differentiable on [(a,b)] and has a local extremum at [c ∈ (a,b)],
    then [h'(c) = 0]. *)
Lemma fermat (h : ℝ → ℝ) (a b c : ℝ)
    (Hab : a < b) (Hac : a < c) (HcB : c < b)
    (Hd : ∀ x, a < x < b → derivable_pt h x)
    (Hloc : (∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, Rabs (x - c) < δ → h x ≤ h c) ∨
            (∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, Rabs (x - c) < δ → h c ≤ h x)) :
    derive_pt h c (Hd c (conj Hac HcB)) = 0.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Mean value theorem *)

(** Theorem 10.4 (mean value theorem): if [h] is continuous on [[a,b]] and
    differentiable on [(a,b)], then there exists [c ∈ (a,b)] with
    [h'(c) = (h(b) - h(a))/(b - a)].

    Proof idea: subtract the secant line from [h] to obtain a function with equal
    values at [a] and [b], then apply Rolle's theorem. *)
Theorem mean_value_theorem (h : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a < b)
    (Hcont : ∀ x, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → continuity_pt h x)
    (Hdiff : ∀ x, a < x ∧ x < b → derivable_pt h x) :
    ∃ c, a < c ∧ c < b ∧
      ∃ Hc : derivable_pt h c,
        derive_pt h c Hc = (h b - h a) / (b - a).
Proof.
  (* Stdlib's [MVT] is the Cauchy form; take the second function to be the
     identity, whose derivative is [1]. *)
  We claim that
    ∀ x : ℝ, a < x ∧ x < b → derivable_pt (fun y => y) x as (Hid).
  {
    Take x : ℝ. Assume that a < x ∧ x < b as (Hx).
    exact (derivable_pt_id x).
  }
  We claim that
    ∀ x : ℝ, a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b → continuity_pt (fun y => y) x as (Hcid).
  {
    Take x : ℝ. Assume that a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b as (Hx).
    exact (derivable_continuous_pt (fun y => y) x (derivable_pt_id x)).
  }
  destruct (MVT h (fun y => y) a b Hdiff Hid Hab Hcont Hcid) as [c Hc].
  destruct Hc as [P Heq].
  (* The derivative of the identity is 1, independently of the proof term. *)
  By (pr_nu (fun y => y) c (Hid c P) (derivable_pt_id c)) it holds that
    derive_pt (fun y => y) c (Hid c P)
      = derive_pt (fun y => y) c (derivable_pt_id c) as (Hpr).
  By derive_pt_id it holds that
    derive_pt (fun y => y) c (derivable_pt_id c) = 1 as (Hd1).
  It holds that
    (b - a) * derive_pt h c (Hdiff c P) = h b - h a as (Heq2).
  (* Divide by [b - a]. *)
  It holds that b - a ≠ 0 as (Hne).
  By Rinv_r it holds that (b - a) * / (b - a) = 1 as (Ei).
  It holds that (b - a) * ((h b - h a) / (b - a)) = h b - h a as (Hr).
  It holds that (b - a) * derive_pt h c (Hdiff c P)
    = (b - a) * ((h b - h a) / (b - a)) as (Hmul).
  By Rmult_eq_reg_l it holds that
    derive_pt h c (Hdiff c P) = (h b - h a) / (b - a) as (Hfin).
  Choose c1 := c.
  We claim that
    ∃ Hc : derivable_pt h c,
      derive_pt h c Hc = (h b - h a) / (b - a) as (Hex).
  { Choose Hc := (Hdiff c P). exact Hfin. }
  It holds that a < c as (H1).
  It holds that c < b as (H2).
  We conclude that
    (a < c ∧ c < b ∧
     ∃ Hc : derivable_pt h c, derive_pt h c Hc = (h b - h a) / (b - a)).
Qed.

(** ** Consequence: zero derivative implies constant *)

(** If [φ] is differentiable with [φ'(x) = 0] everywhere, then [φ] is constant. *)
Lemma zero_derivative_constant (phi : ℝ → ℝ) (Hd : derivable phi)
    (Hz : ∀ x ∈ ℝ, derive_pt phi x (Hd x) = 0) :
    ∀ x ∈ ℝ, ∀ y ∈ ℝ, phi x = phi y.
Proof.
  (* Stdlib's [null_derivative_1] gives [constant phi]. *)
  We claim that ∀ x : ℝ, derive_pt phi x (Hd x) = 0 as (Hz').
  {
    Take x : ℝ.
    By Hz we conclude that derive_pt phi x (Hd x) = 0.
  }
  By (null_derivative_1 phi Hd Hz') it holds that constant phi as (Hconst).
  Take x ∈ ℝ. Take y ∈ ℝ.
  By Hconst we conclude that phi x = phi y.

(** ** MVT consequence: bound on function growth *)

(** If [|φ'| ≤ M] on an interval, then [|φ(b) - φ(a)| ≤ M · |b - a|]. *)
Lemma mvt_bound (psi : ℝ → ℝ) (Hd : derivable psi) (a v : ℝ)
    (M : ℝ) (HM : ∀ x : ℝ, Rabs (derive_pt psi x (Hd x)) ≤ M) :
    Rabs (psi v - psi a) ≤ M * Rabs (v - a).
Proof.
  (* [MVT_cor1] on the relevant orientation of [[a, v]]. *)
  By HM it holds that Rabs (derive_pt psi a (Hd a)) ≤ M as (Hma).
  By Rabs_pos it holds that 0 ≤ Rabs (derive_pt psi a (Hd a)) as (Hpa).

    By HM it holds that Rabs (derive_pt psi c (Hd c)) ≤ M as (Hb).
    By Rabs_pos it holds that 0 ≤ Rabs (v - a) as (Hp).
    rewrite Heq.
    By Rabs_mult it holds that
      Rabs (derive_pt psi c (Hd c) * (v - a))
        = Rabs (derive_pt psi c (Hd c)) * Rabs (v - a) as (Hm).
    rewrite Hm.
    We conclude that
      Rabs (derive_pt psi c (Hd c)) * Rabs (v - a) ≤ M * Rabs (v - a).
  - Case (¬ (a < v)).
    Either (v < a) or (¬ (v < a)).

      By HM it holds that Rabs (derive_pt psi c (Hd c)) ≤ M as (Hb).
      By Rabs_minus_sym it holds that
        Rabs (psi v - psi a) = Rabs (psi a - psi v) as (Hsym).
      By Rabs_minus_sym it holds that
        Rabs (a - v) = Rabs (v - a) as (Hsym2).
      By Rabs_pos it holds that 0 ≤ Rabs (v - a) as (Hp).

(** ** Derivative of the squaring function *)

(** Theorem 10.1: the derivative of [x ↦ x²] at [x₀] is [2·x₀].

    Proof idea: apply the power rule [d/dx xⁿ = n·xⁿ⁻¹] with [n = 2]. *)
Lemma sq_derivative (x0 : ℝ) :
    derive_pt (fun y => y ^ 2) x0 (derivable_pt_pow 2 x0) = 2 * x0.
Proof.
  (* Power rule with [n = 2]. *)
  rewrite derive_pt_pow.
  We conclude that INR 2 * x0 ^ (2 - 1) = 2 * x0.
Qed.

(** ** Rolle's theorem *)

(** Theorem 10.3 (Rolle's theorem): if [h] is continuous on [[a,b]],
    differentiable on [(a,b)] and [h a = h b], then [h'(c) = 0] for some
    [c ∈ (a,b)].

    Proof idea: by the extreme value theorem [h] attains a maximum and a minimum
    on [[a,b]]. If both occur at the endpoints then [h] is constant and any
    interior point works; otherwise an interior extremum has, by Fermat's
    theorem, a vanishing derivative. *)
Lemma rolle_theorem (h : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a < b)
    (Hcont : ∀ c : ℝ, a ≤ c ∧ c ≤ b → continuity_pt h c)
    (Hd : ∀ c : ℝ, a < c ∧ c < b → derivable_pt h c)
    (Heq : h a = h b) :
    ∃ c : ℝ, a < c ∧ c < b ∧ ∃ Hc : a < c ∧ c < b, derive_pt h c (Hd c Hc) = 0.
Proof.
  (* This is Stdlib's [Rolle], repackaged. *)
  destruct (Rolle h a b Hd Hcont Hab Heq) as [c Hc].
  destruct Hc as [P Hderiv].
  Choose c1 := c.
  We claim that
    ∃ Hc : a < c ∧ c < b, derive_pt h c (Hd c Hc) = 0 as (Hex).
  { Choose Hc := P. exact Hderiv. }
  It holds that a < c as (H1).
  It holds that c < b as (H2).
  We conclude that
    (a < c ∧ c < b ∧ ∃ Hc : a < c ∧ c < b, derive_pt h c (Hd c Hc) = 0).
Qed.

(** ** Darboux's theorem *)

(** Theorem 10.6 (Darboux): derivatives have the intermediate value property.
    If [h] is differentiable on [[a,b]] and [v] lies strictly between [h'(a)]
    and [h'(b)], then [h'(c) = v] for some [c ∈ (a,b)] — even though [h'] need
    not be continuous.

    Proof idea: consider [g(x) = h(x) - v·x], which is differentiable with
    [g'(a)] and [g'(b)] of opposite sign. By the extreme value theorem [g]
    attains an interior extremum at some [c ∈ (a,b)], and Fermat's theorem gives
    [g'(c) = 0], i.e. [h'(c) = v]. *)
Theorem darboux_theorem (h : ℝ → ℝ) (a b v : ℝ) (Hab : a < b)
    (Hd : derivable h)
    (Hva : derive_pt h a (Hd a) < v)
    (Hvb : v < derive_pt h b (Hd b)) :
    ∃ c, a < c ∧ c < b ∧ derive_pt h c (Hd c) = v.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** A differentiability example *)

(** Exercise: the function [g(x) = x²·sin(1/x)] for [x ≠ 0] and [g(0) = 0] is
    differentiable at [0] with [g'(0) = 0], yet [g'] is not continuous at [0].

    Proof idea: the difference quotient [g(x)/x = x·sin(1/x) → 0] as [x → 0] by
    the squeeze theorem, so [g'(0) = 0]. For [x ≠ 0],
    [g'(x) = 2x·sin(1/x) - cos(1/x)] has no limit as [x → 0]. *)
Lemma differentiable_example
    (g : ℝ → ℝ)
    (Hg : ∀ x : ℝ, x ≠ 0 → g x = x ^ 2 * sin (1 / x)) (Hg0 : g 0 = 0) :
    ∃ Hd : derivable_pt g 0, derive_pt g 0 Hd = 0.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** A continuous nowhere-differentiable function *)

(** Pathology: there exists a function [f : ℝ → ℝ] that is continuous at every
    point yet differentiable at no point.

    Proof idea (Weierstrass / Abbott's construction): let [w(x)] be the
    distance from [x] to the nearest integer, and set
    [f(x) = ∑ (1/2)ⁿ · w(2ⁿ x)]. The series converges uniformly (Weierstrass
    M-test) so [f] is continuous; a careful estimate of difference quotients
    along dyadic points shows [f] is differentiable nowhere. *)
Theorem nowhere_differentiable_function :
    ∃ f : ℝ → ℝ,
      (∀ x : ℝ, continuity_pt f x) ∧
      (∀ x : ℝ, ¬ (∃ l : ℝ, derivable_pt_lim f x l)).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Positive derivative implies strictly increasing *)

(** Theorem 10.5: if [ψ' > 0] on [(a,v)] then [ψ] is strictly increasing on
    [[a,v]].

    Proof idea: for [a ≤ x < y ≤ v], the mean value theorem gives a point
    [c ∈ (x,y) ⊂ (a,v)] with [ψ(y) - ψ(x) = ψ'(c)·(y - x)]. Since [ψ'(c) > 0]
    and [y - x > 0], we get [ψ(y) > ψ(x)]. *)
Lemma positive_derivative_strictly_increasing (psi : ℝ → ℝ) (Hd : derivable psi)
    (a v : ℝ)
    (Hderiv_pos : ∀ x : ℝ, a < x ∧ x < v → 0 < derive_pt psi x (Hd x)) :
    ∀ x ∈ ℝ, ∀ y ∈ ℝ, a ≤ x → x < y → y ≤ v → psi x < psi y.
Proof.
  (* Exactly Stdlib's [derive_increasing_interv]. *)
  Take x ∈ ℝ. Take y ∈ ℝ.
  Assume that a ≤ x as (H1).
  Assume that x < y as (H2).
  Assume that y ≤ v as (H3).
  It holds that a < v as (Hav).
