(** ** Pointwise convergence *)

(** The sequence of functions [fₙ(x) = x/n]. *)
Definition fx_over_n : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ := fun n x => x / INR n.

(** The constant zero function. *)
Definition zero_fn : ℝ → ℝ := fun _ => 0.

(** [(fₙ)] converges pointwise to [g] on [A] iff for each [x ∈ A], [fₙ(x) → g(x)]. *)
(** This is [converges_pointwise fn g A] from [Analysis.Lib.UniformConvergence]. *)

(** The sequence [fₙ(x) = x/n] converges pointwise to [0].

    Proof idea: for each fixed [x] and [ε > 0], the Archimedean property gives
    [N > |x|/ε]; then for [n ≥ N ≥ 1], [|fₙ(x)| = |x|/n ≤ |x|/N < ε]. Here the
    threshold [N] depends on [x]. *)
Lemma x_over_n_pointwise :
    converges_pointwise (fun n x => x / INR n) (fun _ => 0) (fun _ => True).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** Pointwise limit of continuous functions need not be continuous. *)
(** (illustrated by fₙ(x) = xⁿ on [0,1]; limit is the step function) *)

(** ** Uniform convergence *)

(** Uniform convergence on a set implies pointwise convergence.

    Proof idea: for a fixed [x ∈ A], the uniform threshold [N] (which works for
    all points simultaneously) works in particular for the single point [x]. *)
Lemma uniform_implies_pointwise (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (A : subset ℝ)
    (H : converges_uniformly fn g A) :
    converges_pointwise fn g A.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence *)

(** Theorem 12.4: [(fₙ)] converges uniformly on [A] iff it is uniformly Cauchy:
    for every ε > 0 there exists N such that for all [n, m ≥ N] and all [x ∈ A],
    [|fₙ(x) - fₘ(x)| < ε].

    Proof idea (⇒): by the triangle inequality
    [|fₙ(x) - fₘ(x)| ≤ |fₙ(x) - g(x)| + |g(x) - fₘ(x)| < ε/2 + ε/2 = ε]. *)
Lemma uniform_cauchy_criterion (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (A : subset ℝ) :
    (∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, converges_uniformly fn g A) ⇔
    (∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, ∀ x ∈ A,
      Rabs (fn n x - fn m x) < ε).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous *)

(** Theorem 12.1: if each [fₙ] is continuous at [a] and [(fₙ) ⇉ g] uniformly on
    a neighborhood of [a], then [g] is continuous at [a].

    Proof idea (3ε argument): given [ε > 0], (1) uniform convergence gives [N]
    with [|f_N(x) - g(x)| < ε/3] for all [x]; (2) continuity of [f_N] at [a]
    gives [δ] with [|f_N(x) - f_N(a)| < ε/3] for [|x - a| < δ]; (3) then
    [|g(x) - g(a)| ≤ |g(x) - f_N(x)| + |f_N(x) - f_N(a)| + |f_N(a) - g(a)| < ε]. *)
Theorem uniform_limit_continuous (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ)
    (Hfn : ∀ n ∈ ℕ, continuity_pt (fn n) a)
    (Hunif : ∃ A : subset ℝ, A a ∧ converges_uniformly fn g A) :
    continuity_pt g a.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Weierstrass M-test *)

(** Theorem 12.2 (Weierstrass M-test): if [|fₙ(x)| ≤ Mₙ] for all [x ∈ A] and
    [∑ Mₙ] converges, then [∑ fₙ] converges uniformly on [A].

    Proof idea: use the Cauchy criterion. Since [∑ Mₙ] converges, for [ε > 0]
    there is an [N] such that for [m > n ≥ N],
    [|∑_{k=n+1}^m fₖ(x)| ≤ ∑_{k=n+1}^m |fₖ(x)| ≤ ∑_{k=n+1}^m Mₖ < ε],
    uniformly in [x]. *)
Theorem weierstrass_M_test (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (M : ℕ → ℝ) (A : subset ℝ)
    (Hbound : ∀ n ∈ ℕ, ∀ x ∈ A, Rabs (fn n x) ≤ M n)
    (HM : ∃ L ∈ ℝ, (fun n => sum_f_R0 M n) ⟶ L) :
    ∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, converges_uniformly (fun n x => sum_f_R0 (fun k => fn k x) n) g A.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Term-by-term integration *)

(** _Interchange of limit and integral_ (Abbott 6.4.1): if [(fₙ) ⇉ g] uniformly
    on [[a, b]] and each [fₙ] is integrable, then [g] is integrable and
    [∫_a^b fₙ → ∫_a^b g].

    Here [I n = ∫_a^b fₙ] and [Ig = ∫_a^b g] are the recorded integral values.

    Proof idea: uniform convergence lets the error [∫|fₙ - g| ≤ (b - a)·‖fₙ - g‖∞]
    be made arbitrarily small, so the integrals converge. *)
Theorem uniform_limit_integral (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a ≤ b)
    (Hunif : converges_uniformly fn g (fun x => a ≤ x ∧ x ≤ b))
    (I : ℕ → ℝ) (Ig : ℝ)
    (HI : ∀ n : ℕ, ∀ pr : Riemann_integrable (fn n) a b, I n = RiemannInt pr)
    (HIg : ∀ pr : Riemann_integrable g a b, Ig = RiemannInt pr) :
    I ⟶ Ig.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Uniform convergence of [x/n] on a bounded interval *)

(** [fₙ(x) = x/n] converges uniformly to [0] on [[−R, R]].

    Proof idea: for [x ∈ [−R, R]] and [n ≥ 1], [|fₙ(x)| = |x|/n ≤ R/n]. The
    bound [R/n] is independent of [x] and tends to [0], giving a uniform
    threshold. *)
Lemma x_over_n_uniform (bR : ℝ) (HR : bR > 0) :
    converges_uniformly fx_over_n zero_fn (fun x => -bR ≤ x ∧ x ≤ bR).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** A pointwise-only example *)

(** [fₙ(0) = 0ⁿ → 0] (pointwise value at the origin).

    For [fₙ(x) = xⁿ] on [[0,1]] and the point [x = 0], [fₙ(0) = 0ⁿ = 0] for all
    [n ≥ 1], so the sequence is eventually the constant [0]. (More generally
    [xⁿ → 0] for [0 ≤ x < 1] and [1ⁿ → 1], so the pointwise limit is the
    indicator of [{1}], which is not continuous.) *)
Lemma zero_pow_to_zero : (fun n : ℕ => (0 : ℝ) ^ n) ⟶ 0.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Uniform convergence of the geometric series on [[−r, r]] *)

(** Theorem 12.3: for [0 ≤ r < 1], the partial sums [∑ xᵏ] converge uniformly on
    [[−r, r]].

    Proof idea: apply the Weierstrass M-test with [Mₙ = rⁿ]. For [x ∈ [−r, r]],
    [|xⁿ| = |x|ⁿ ≤ rⁿ], and [∑ rⁿ = 1/(1 - r) < ∞]. The uniform limit is
    [g(x) = 1/(1 - x)]. *)
Lemma geometric_series_uniform (r : ℝ) (Hr0 : 0 ≤ r) (Hr1 : r < 1) :
    ∃ g : ℝ → ℝ,
      converges_uniformly
        (fun n x => sum_f_R0 (fun k => x ^ k) n) g (fun x => -r ≤ x ∧ x ≤ r).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** The supremum characterization of uniform convergence *)

(** _Mₙ-test_: [(fₙ) ⇉ g] uniformly on [A] iff there is a sequence [Mₙ → 0]
    dominating the pointwise errors, [|fₙ(x) - g(x)| ≤ Mₙ] for all [x ∈ A].
    (One may take [Mₙ = sup_{x ∈ A} |fₙ(x) - g(x)|].)

    Proof idea: (⇒) the uniform threshold provides such a bounding [Mₙ].
    (⇐) [Mₙ → 0] gives a single [N] making all errors [< ε] simultaneously. *)
Lemma uniform_convergence_sup_characterization
    (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (A : subset ℝ) :
    converges_uniformly fn g A ⇔
    (∃ M : ℕ → ℝ,
      (∀ n ∈ ℕ, ∀ x ∈ ℝ, A x → Rabs (fn n x - g x) ≤ M n) ∧ M ⟶ 0).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** The example [fₙ(x) = xⁿ] *)

(** [fₙ(x) = xⁿ] converges pointwise to [0] on [[0, 1)].

    Proof idea: for fixed [0 ≤ x < 1], [xⁿ → 0] (geometric decay); the rate
    depends on how close [x] is to [1]. *)
Lemma x_pow_n_pointwise :
    converges_pointwise (fun n x => x ^ n) (fun _ => 0)
      (fun x => 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 1).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** The convergence [xⁿ → 0] on [[0, 1)] is *not* uniform.

    Proof idea: for any [n], points [x] near [1] have [xⁿ] near [1], so
    [sup_{x ∈ [0,1)} |xⁿ - 0| = 1] does not tend to [0]; equivalently the
    [Mₙ]-test fails. *)
Lemma x_pow_n_not_uniform :
    ¬ (∃ g : ℝ → ℝ,
        converges_uniformly (fun n x => x ^ n) g (fun x => 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 1)).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** The triangle (tent) sequence *)

(** The *triangle sequence* [Tₙ] is the tent of height [n] and base
    [(0, 2/n)] centred at [1/n]:
    [Tₙ(x) = max(0, n - n²·|x - 1/n|)]. *)
Definition triangle_sequence : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ :=
    fun n x => Rmax 0 (INR n - (INR n) ^ 2 * Rabs (x - / INR n)).

(** The triangle sequence converges pointwise to [0] on [[0, 1]], even though
    each [Tₙ] has a spike of height [n].

    Proof idea: [Tₙ(0) = 0] for all [n]; for a fixed [x > 0], once [2/n < x] the
    support of [Tₙ] no longer contains [x], so [Tₙ(x) = 0] eventually. (This is
    the standard example where [lim ∫ Tₙ ≠ ∫ lim Tₙ].) *)
Lemma triangle_sequence_pointwise :
    converges_pointwise triangle_sequence (fun _ => 0)
      (fun x => 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 1).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Uniform convergence of [√(x² + 1/n)] *)

(** Exercise: [fₙ(x) = √(x² + 1/n)] converges uniformly to [|x|] on all of [ℝ].

    Proof idea: [0 ≤ √(x² + 1/n) - |x| = (1/n)/(√(x² + 1/n) + |x|) ≤ √(1/n)],
    a bound independent of [x] tending to [0]. *)
Lemma sqrt_x_sq_plus_1_over_n_uniform :
    converges_uniformly (fun n x => sqrt (x ^ 2 + / INR n)) Rabs
      (fun _ => True).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Uniform convergence and differentiation *)

(** _Differentiability transfer lemma_ (Abbott 6.3.1): if each [fₙ] is
    differentiable on [[a, b]] with derivative [dfnₙ], and the derivatives
    [(dfnₙ)] are uniformly Cauchy, then the differences [fₙ - fₘ] are uniformly
    Lipschitz, with constant controlled by the derivative gap.

    Proof idea: apply the mean value theorem to [fₙ - fₘ] on [[x, y]]:
    [(fₙ - fₘ)(x) - (fₙ - fₘ)(y) = ((dfnₙ - dfnₘ)(ξ))·(x - y)] for some [ξ]. *)
Lemma differentiability_transfer_lemma
    (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (dfn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a < b)
    (Hderiv : ∀ n ∈ ℕ, ∀ x ∈ ℝ, a ≤ x → x ≤ b →
        ∃ Hd : derivable_pt (fn n) x, derive_pt (fn n) x Hd = dfn n x)
    (Hdcauchy : ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, ∀ x : ℝ,
        a ≤ x → x ≤ b → Rabs (dfn n x - dfn m x) < ε) :
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, ∀ x ∈ ℝ, ∀ y ∈ ℝ,
      a ≤ x → x ≤ b → a ≤ y → y ≤ b →
      Rabs ((fn n x - fn m x) - (fn n y - fn m y)) ≤ ε * Rabs (x - y).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** _Differentiability theorem_ (Abbott 6.3.3): if each [fₙ] is differentiable
    on [[a, b]] with derivative [dfnₙ], the derivatives converge uniformly to
    [h], and [(fₙ)] converges at one point, then [(fₙ)] converges uniformly to a
    limit [g] with [g' = h].

    Proof idea: the transfer lemma makes [(fₙ)] uniformly Cauchy (hence
    uniformly convergent to some [g]); a difference-quotient estimate shows [g]
    is differentiable with [g' = h = lim dfnₙ]. *)
Theorem uniform_differentiability_theorem
    (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (dfn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (g h : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) (Hab : a < b)

Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Series of functions *)

(** The partial sums [Sₙ(x) = ∑_{k=0}^n fₖ(x)] of a series of functions. *)
Definition series_partial_sums (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ :=
    fun n x => sum_f_R0 (fun k => fn k x) n.

(** The series [∑ fₙ] *converges uniformly* to [g] on [A] when its partial sums
    do. *)
Definition series_converges_uniformly
    (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (A : subset ℝ) : Prop :=
    converges_uniformly (series_partial_sums fn) g A.

(** _Cauchy criterion for series of functions_: [∑ fₙ] converges uniformly on
    [A] iff its partial sums are uniformly Cauchy — equivalently the tails
    [∑_{k=n+1}^m fₖ] are uniformly small.

    Proof idea: apply the Cauchy criterion for uniform convergence
    ([uniform_cauchy_criterion]) to the sequence of partial sums. *)
Lemma series_cauchy_criterion_functions (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (A : subset ℝ) :
    (∃ g : ℝ → ℝ, series_converges_uniformly fn g A) ⇔
    (∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, ∀ x ∈ A,
      Rabs (series_partial_sums fn n x - series_partial_sums fn m x) < ε).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** _Term-wise continuity of a series_: if each [fₙ] is continuous at [a] and
    [∑ fₙ] converges uniformly on a neighbourhood of [a], then the sum is
    continuous at [a].

    Proof idea: each partial sum is continuous (finite sum of continuous
    functions); apply [uniform_limit_continuous] to the partial sums. *)
Theorem termwise_continuity_series
    (fn : ℕ → ℝ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ)
    (Hcont : ∀ n ∈ ℕ, continuity_pt (fn n) a)
    (Hunif : ∃ A : subset ℝ, A a ∧ series_converges_uniformly fn g A) :
    continuity_pt g a.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** _Term-wise differentiability of a series_ (Abbott 6.4.3): if each [fₙ] is
    differentiable on [[a, b]] with derivative [dfnₙ], the series of derivatives
    [∑ dfnₙ] converges uniformly to [h], and [∑ fₙ] converges at one point, then
    [∑ fₙ] converges uniformly to a differentiable [g] with [g' = h].

    Proof idea: apply [uniform_differentiability_theorem] to the partial sums,
    whose derivatives are the partial sums of the derivative series. Compact
    intervals are essential. *)
