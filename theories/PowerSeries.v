(** ** Radius of convergence *)

(** The radius of convergence of [∑ aₙ xⁿ] is the supremum of all [r ≥ 0]
    for which the series converges. *)

(** A power series converging at [x₀] converges absolutely on [(-|x₀|, |x₀|)].

    Proof idea: from convergence at [x₀] the terms [aₙ x₀ⁿ] are bounded, say
    [|aₙ x₀ⁿ| ≤ M]. Then [|aₙ xⁿ| = |aₙ x₀ⁿ| · |x/x₀|ⁿ ≤ M · |x/x₀|ⁿ], and
    [|x/x₀| < 1] gives a convergent geometric bound. *)

    (H : ∃ L : ℝ, ∑ (fun n => a n * x0 ^ n) ⟶ L)
    (x : ℝ) (Hx : Rabs x < Rabs x0) :
    ∃ L : ℝ, ∑ (fun n => Rabs (a n * x ^ n)) ⟶ L.
Proof.

(** ** Uniform convergence on compact sub-intervals *)

(** Theorem 13.3: if the radius of convergence is [R > 0], then [∑ aₙ xⁿ]
    converges uniformly on every [[−r, r]] with [r < R].

    Proof idea: pick [r'] with [r < r' < R]. The series converges absolutely at
    [r'], so [∑ |aₙ| (r')ⁿ < ∞]. For [x ∈ [−r, r]],
    [|aₙ xⁿ| ≤ |aₙ| rⁿ ≤ |aₙ| (r')ⁿ], so the Weierstrass M-test gives uniform
    convergence. *)

    (Hconv : ∀ x : ℝ, Rabs x < R →

        (fun N x => sum_f_R0 (fun n => a n * x ^ n) N)
        g
        (fun x => Rabs x ≤ r).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** The predicate "[g] is the sum of the power series [∑ aₙ xⁿ] on the disc of
    radius [R]": for every [x] with [|x| < R], the partial sums converge to
    [g(x)]. This lets us talk about the limit function without constructing it
    explicitly. *)
Definition is_series_sum (a : ℕ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (R : ℝ) : Prop :=
    ∀ x : ℝ, Rabs x < R → ∑ (fun n => a n * x ^ n) ⟶ g x.

(** ** Radius of convergence *)

(** _Existence of the radius of convergence_: for every coefficient sequence
    with a finite radius there is [R ≥ 0] such that the series converges for
    [|x| < R] and diverges for [|x| > R].

    Proof idea (Cauchy–Hadamard / root test): [R = 1 / limsup |aₙ|^{1/n}]. Below
    [R] the root test gives convergence; above [R] the terms do not tend to [0].
    (When the radius is infinite the "diverges" clause is vacuous.) *)
Lemma radius_of_convergence (a : ℕ → ℝ) :
    ∃ R : ℝ, R ≥ 0 ∧
      (∀ x : ℝ, Rabs x < R → ∃ L : ℝ, ∑ (fun n => a n * x ^ n) ⟶ L) ∧
      (∀ x : ℝ, Rabs x > R → ¬ (∃ L : ℝ, ∑ (fun n => a n * x ^ n) ⟶ L)).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Absolute convergence strictly inside the radius *)

(** Theorem 13.2: if the series converges at every [r] with [0 < r < R], then it
    converges absolutely at every [x] with [|x| < R].

    Proof idea: pick [r] with [|x| < r < R] (e.g. [r = (|x| + R)/2]); the series
    converges at [r], so [abel_lemma] with [x₀ = r] gives absolute convergence
    at [x]. *)
Lemma power_series_abs_convergent (a : ℕ → ℝ) (R : ℝ) (HR : R > 0)
    (Hcv_inside : ∀ r : ℝ, 0 < r → r < R →
      ∃ L : ℝ, ∑ (fun n => a n * r ^ n) ⟶ L)
    (x : ℝ) (Hx : Rabs x < R) :
    ∃ L : ℝ, ∑ (fun n => Rabs (a n * x ^ n)) ⟶ L.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Continuity of a power series *)

(** A power series is continuous on its open interval of convergence.

    Proof idea: on each [[−r, r]] with [r < R] the series converges uniformly
    (Theorem 13.3), and each partial sum is a (continuous) polynomial; the
    uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous. *)
Lemma power_series_continuous (a : ℕ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (R : ℝ) (HR : R > 0)
    (Hsum : is_series_sum a g R)
    (x : ℝ) (Hx : Rabs x < R) :
    continuity_pt g x.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Abel's summation by parts *)

(** _Abel's summation by parts_: with partial sums [Bₖ = ∑_{j=0}^k bⱼ],
    [∑_{k=0}^{n+1} aₖ bₖ = a_{n+1} B_{n+1} - ∑_{k=0}^n (a_{k+1} - aₖ) Bₖ].

    Proof idea: substitute [bₖ = Bₖ - B_{k-1}] and reindex the sum. *)
Lemma abel_summation_by_parts (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (n : ℕ) :
    sum_f_R0 (fun k => a k * b k) (S n) =
    a (S n) * sum_f_R0 b (S n)
    - sum_f_R0 (fun k => (a (S k) - a k) * sum_f_R0 b k) n.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** _Abel's lemma_ (bounded partial sums): if [(aₖ)] is nonnegative and
    decreasing and the partial sums of [(bₖ)] are bounded by [M], then
    [|∑_{k=0}^n aₖ bₖ| ≤ a₀·M].

    Proof idea: apply summation by parts; the decreasing nonnegative weights
    make the estimate telescope to [a₀·M]. *)
Lemma abel_lemma_bounded_partial_sums (a b : ℕ → ℝ) (n : ℕ) (M : ℝ)
    (Hdec : ∀ k : ℕ, 0 ≤ a (S k) ∧ a (S k) ≤ a k)
    (Hbound : ∀ k : ℕ, Rabs (sum_f_R0 b k) ≤ M) :
    Rabs (sum_f_R0 (fun k => a k * b k) n) ≤ a 0%nat * M.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Abel's theorem *)

(** _Abel's theorem_: if [∑ aₙ Rⁿ] converges at the endpoint [R > 0], then the
    power series converges uniformly on [[0, R]] (so its sum is continuous up to
    the endpoint).

    Proof idea: apply Abel's lemma to the tails, writing [aₙ xⁿ = (aₙ Rⁿ)(x/R)ⁿ]
    with decreasing weights [(x/R)ⁿ] and bounded partial sums of [(aₙ Rⁿ)]. *)
Theorem abel_theorem (a : ℕ → ℝ) (R : ℝ) (HR : R > 0)
    (Hend : ∃ L : ℝ, ∑ (fun n => a n * R ^ n) ⟶ L) :
    ∃ g : ℝ → ℝ,
      converges_uniformly (fun N x => sum_f_R0 (fun n => a n * x ^ n) N) g
        (fun x => 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ R).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Term-by-term differentiation *)

(** Theorem 13.4 (term-by-term differentiation): the sum [g] of [∑ aₙ xⁿ] is
    differentiable on [(−R, R)], and its derivative is the sum [h] of the derived
    series [∑ (n+1) a_{n+1} xⁿ] — which has the same radius [R].

    Proof idea: (1) the derived series has the same radius [R]; (2) it converges
    uniformly on [[−r, r]] for [r < R]; (3) apply the term-wise differentiability
    theorem ([uniform_differentiability_theorem]) to the partial sums. *)
Lemma power_series_termwise_derivative (a : ℕ → ℝ) (g h : ℝ → ℝ) (R : ℝ)
    (HR : R > 0) (Hsum : is_series_sum a g R)
    (Hder : is_series_sum (fun n => INR (S n) * a (S n)) h R)
    (x : ℝ) (Hx : Rabs x < R) :
    ∃ Hd : derivable_pt g x, derive_pt g x Hd = h x.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** ** Infinite differentiability and Taylor coefficients *)

(** A power series is infinitely differentiable on [(−R, R)], and its
    coefficients are its Taylor coefficients: [aₙ = g^{(n)}(0) / n!]. In
    particular [a₀ = g(0)].

    Proof idea: iterate term-by-term differentiation; each derived series again
    has radius [R], so [g] has derivatives of all orders, and evaluating the
    [n]-th derived series at [0] isolates [n!·aₙ]. *)
Theorem power_series_infinitely_differentiable
    (a : ℕ → ℝ) (g : ℝ → ℝ) (R : ℝ) (HR : R > 0) (Hsum : is_series_sum a g R) :
    (∀ x : ℝ, Rabs x < R → ∃ l : ℝ, derivable_pt_lim g x l) ∧ a 0%nat = g 0.
Proof.
  Admitted.
