(** * RUG.Analysis.SequenceExamples — Examples of sequence limits.

  #<a href="../../index.html##lecture03">Lecture 3</a>#.

  Contains examples from Lecture 3: specific limit computations and standard limits.
  Formalizes examples from Abbott §2.2–2.3.

  Note: The rational-limit example and the standard limits 1/n, 1/n^2 and c^n
  are fully proved. The nth-root limits and n!/n^n are still admitted: they
  require logarithm/l'Hôpital-style machinery not yet developed here.
  Note: In Rocq/Coq, natural numbers start from 0, but our sequences correspond
  to Abbott's sequences starting from n=1. We use (n+1) or (INR n + 1) consistently. *)

(** ** Basic limit examples from lecture 3 *)


(** ** Example: limit of (6n+7)/(3n+1)

  Claim: $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{6n+7}{3n+1} = 2$ (where n starts from 1 in Abbott).

  In Rocq, we use (n+1) to match Abbott's indexing: the sequence is
  $$\frac{6(n+1)+7}{3(n+1)+1} = \frac{6n+13}{3n+4}$$ for n:ℕ.

  Proof sketch:
  $\begin{aligned}
  \left|\frac{6(n+1)+7}{3(n+1)+1} - 2\right| 
  &= \left|\frac{6n+13}{3n+4} - 2\right|
  = \left|\frac{6n+13 - 6n - 8}{3n+4}\right| 
  = \frac{5}{3n+4} < \frac{5}{3(n+1)}. 
  \end{aligned}$

  For any ε > 0, choose N such that 1/(N+1) < 3ε/5. Then for n ≥ N,
  $$\frac{5}{3(n+1)} \leq \frac{5}{3(N+1)} < \varepsilon.$$ *)
Lemma limit_6n_plus_7_over_3n_plus_1 :
    (fun n : ℕ => (6 * (INR n + 1) + 7) / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1)) ⟶ 2.
Proof.
  We need to show that
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1,
      | (6 * (INR n + 1) + 7) / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) - 2 | < ε.
  Take ε > 0.
  It holds that 3 * ε / 5 > 0 as (Heps).
  By archimedean_2 it holds that
    ∃ n1 : ℕ, 1 / (INR n1 + 1) < 3 * ε / 5 as (Hn1).
  Obtain such an n1.
  Choose N1 := n1. { Indeed, N1 ∈ ℕ. }
  We need to show that ∀ n ≥ N1,
    | (6 * (INR n + 1) + 7) / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) - 2 | < ε.
  Take n ≥ N1.
  It holds that INR n ≥ INR n1 as (Hnn1).
  By pos_INR it holds that INR n ≥ 0 as (Hn0).
  By pos_INR it holds that INR n1 ≥ 0 as (Hn10).
  It holds that 3 * (INR n + 1) + 1 > 0 as (Hden).
  It holds that 3 * (INR n1 + 1) > 0 as (Hden1).
  (** The error simplifies to [5 / (3(n+1)+1)], which is positive. *)
  It holds that
    (6 * (INR n + 1) + 7) / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) - 2
    = 5 / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) as (Hval).
  It holds that 0 < 5 / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) as (Hvalpos).
  It holds that
    | (6 * (INR n + 1) + 7) / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) - 2 |
    = 5 / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) as (Habs).
  It holds that 3 * (INR n1 + 1) < 3 * (INR n + 1) + 1 as (Hchain).
  By Rinv_lt_contravar it holds that
    / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) < / (3 * (INR n1 + 1)) as (Hinv).
  It holds that
    5 / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) = 5 * / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) as (Hd1).
  It holds that
    5 / (3 * (INR n1 + 1)) = 5 * / (3 * (INR n1 + 1)) as (Hd2).
  It holds that
    5 / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) < 5 / (3 * (INR n1 + 1)) as (Hb1).
  It holds that
    5 / (3 * (INR n1 + 1)) = (5 / 3) * (1 / (INR n1 + 1)) as (Hb2).
  It holds that
    (5 / 3) * (1 / (INR n1 + 1)) < (5 / 3) * (3 * ε / 5) as (Hb3).
  It holds that (5 / 3) * (3 * ε / 5) = ε as (Hb4).
  We conclude that (&
    | (6 * (INR n + 1) + 7) / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1) - 2 |
    = 5 / (3 * (INR n + 1) + 1)
    < 5 / (3 * (INR n1 + 1))
    = (5 / 3) * (1 / (INR n1 + 1))
    < (5 / 3) * (3 * ε / 5)
    = ε
  ).

(** ** Standard limits from lecture 3 *)


(** ** Standard limit: 1/n → 0 

  Claim: $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$ (where n starts from 1 in Abbott).

  In Rocq, we use (n+1) to match Abbott's indexing: the sequence is 1/(n+1).

  Proof sketch: For ε > 0, by Archimedean property, there exists N such that
  N > 1/ε. Then for n ≥ N, we have n+1 > N ≥ 1/ε, so 1/(n+1) < ε. *)
Lemma standard_limit_1_over_n :
    (fun n : ℕ => 1 / (INR n + 1)) ⟶ 0.
Proof.
  (** This is exactly the harmonic sequence, already proved in
      [Analysis.Sequences]. *)
  By harmonic_to_0 we conclude that (fun n : ℕ => 1 / (INR n + 1)) ⟶ 0.
Qed.


(** ** Standard limit: 1/n^2 → 0

  Claim: $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = 0$ (where n starts from 1 in Abbott).

  In Rocq, we use (n+1) to match Abbott's indexing: the sequence is 1/(n+1)^2.

  Proof sketch: For ε > 0, by Archimedean property, there exists N such that
  N > 1/√ε. Then for n ≥ N, we have n+1 > N ≥ 1/√ε, so (n+1)^2 > 1/ε,
  and thus 1/(n+1)^2 < ε. *)
Lemma standard_limit_1_over_n_squared :
    (fun n : ℕ => 1 / (INR n + 1)^2) ⟶ 0.
Proof.
  (** Squeeze [0 ≤ 1/(n+1)^2 ≤ 1/(n+1)] between the constant [0]
      sequence and the harmonic sequence, both of which converge to [0]. *)
  apply (squeeze_theorem
    (fun _ : ℕ => 0)
    (fun n : ℕ => 1 / (INR n + 1)^2)
    (fun n : ℕ => 1 / (INR n + 1)) 0).
  - By constant_seq_converges we conclude that (fun _ : ℕ => 0) ⟶ 0.
  - By harmonic_to_0 we conclude that (fun n : ℕ => 1 / (INR n + 1)) ⟶ 0.
  - Take n ∈ ℕ.
    It holds that INR n + 1 > 0 as (Hpos).
    It holds that (INR n + 1)^2 > 0.
    We conclude that 0 ≤ 1 / (INR n + 1)^2.
  - Take n ∈ ℕ.
    By pos_INR it holds that INR n ≥ 0 as (Hn0).
    It holds that INR n + 1 ≥ 1 as (Hge1).
    It holds that INR n + 1 > 0 as (Hpos).
    It holds that (INR n + 1)^2 = (INR n + 1) * (INR n + 1) as (Hsq).
    It holds that (INR n + 1) ≤ (INR n + 1)^2 as (Hle).
    By Rinv_le_contravar it holds that
      / (INR n + 1)^2 ≤ / (INR n + 1) as (Hinv).
    It holds that 1 / (INR n + 1)^2 = / (INR n + 1)^2 as (He1).
    It holds that 1 / (INR n + 1) = / (INR n + 1) as (He2).
    We conclude that 1 / (INR n + 1)^2 ≤ 1 / (INR n + 1).
Qed.


(** ** Standard limit: c^n → 0 for |c| < 1

  Claim: $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} c^n = 0$ when -1 < c < 1.

  Note: In Rocq, we start from n=0, but the behavior for large n is the same.
  The sequence c^0, c^1, c^2, ... converges to 0.

  Proof sketch: Let |c| = 1/(1+δ) where δ > 0. Then |c^n| = 1/(1+δ)^n.
  By Bernoulli's inequality, (1+δ)^n ≥ 1 + n·δ ≥ n·δ (for n ≥ 1),
  so |c^n| ≤ 1/(n·δ) → 0. *)
Lemma standard_limit_c_to_n (c : ℝ) :
    -1 < c → c < 1 → (fun n : ℕ => c^n) ⟶ 0.
Proof.
  Assume that -1 < c as (Hlo).
  Assume that c < 1 as (Hhi).
  It holds that | c | < 1 as (Habs).
  We need to show that ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, | c^n - 0 | < ε.
  Take ε > 0.
  (** [pow_lt_1_zero] from the standard library gives exactly the
      threshold we need for a base of absolute value less than 1. *)
  By pow_lt_1_zero it holds that
    ∃ Nm : ℕ, ∀ n : ℕ, (n ≥ Nm)%nat ⇨ | c^n | < ε as (HN).
  Obtain such an Nm.
  Choose N1 := Nm. { Indeed, N1 ∈ ℕ. }
  We need to show that ∀ n ≥ N1, | c^n - 0 | < ε.
  Take n ≥ N1.
  By HN it holds that | c^n | < ε.
  We conclude that | c^n - 0 | < ε.
Qed.


(** ** Standard limit: nth root of c → 1 for c > 0

  Claim: $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{c} = 1$ for any c > 0 (where n starts from 1 in Abbott).

  In Rocq, we use (n+1) to match Abbott's indexing. Note that Rpower is used for real exponentiation.

  Proof sketch: If c = 1, trivial. If c > 1, let c = 1+h with h > 0.
  By Bernoulli, (1+h)^n ≥ 1 + n·h, so √[n+1]{c} = (1+h)^(1/(n+1)) ≤ (1 + n·h)^(1/(n+1)).
  Taking logs and using l'Hôpital's rule shows the limit is 1.
  For 0 < c < 1, use 1/c > 1 and √[n+1]{c} = 1/√[n+1]{1/c}. *)
Lemma standard_limit_nth_root_of_c (c : ℝ) :
    c > 0 → (fun n : ℕ => Rpower c (1 / (INR n + 1))) ⟶ 1.
Proof.
  Admitted.


(** ** Standard limit: nth root of n → 1

  Claim: $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{n} = 1$ (where n starts from 1 in Abbott).

  In Rocq, we use (n+1) to match Abbott's indexing. Note that Rpower is used for real exponentiation.

  Proof sketch: For n ≥ 1, we have 1 < √[n+1]{n+1}. Consider ln(√[n+1]{n+1}) = ln(n+1)/(n+1) → 0,
  so √[n+1]{n+1} = e^(ln(n+1)/(n+1)) → e^0 = 1. *)
Lemma standard_limit_nth_root_of_n : 
    (fun n : ℕ => Rpower (INR n + 1) (1 / (INR n + 1))) ⟶ 1.
Proof.
  Admitted.


(** ** Standard limit: n! / n^n → 0

  Claim: $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n!}{n^n} = 0$ (where n starts from 1 in Abbott).

  In Rocq, we use (n+1) to match Abbott's indexing. We use Stdlib.Arith.Factorial.fact
  which computes factorial of natural numbers.

  Proof sketch: Note that n! / n^n = ∏_{k=1}^n (k/n) ≤ (1/√n)^(n/2) by pairing
  terms k and n-k: (k/n)·((n-k)/n) = k(n-k)/n^2 ≤ 1/4 for k = n/2.
  So n! / n^n ≤ (1/4)^(n/2) → 0. *)
Lemma standard_limit_n_factorial_over_n_to_n : 
    (fun n : ℕ => INR (Stdlib.Arith.Factorial.fact (S n)) / (INR (S n))^(S n)) ⟶ 0.
Proof.
  Admitted.
