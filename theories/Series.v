(** ** Series and partial sums *)

(** An infinite series [∑ aₖ] is described through its partial sums
    [Sₙ = ∑_{k=0}^n aₖ], written [partial_sums a n] (i.e. [sum_f_R0 a n]).
    The series converges to [L] when [partial_sums a ⟶ L].

    The Cauchy criterion for sequences used below ([convergent_is_cauchy] and
    [cauchy_is_convergent]) lives in [Analysis.CauchySequences]. *)

(** ** Necessary condition: terms go to zero *)

(** If [∑ aₙ] converges then [aₙ → 0].

    Proof idea: [aₙ = sₙ - sₙ₋₁]; if [sₙ → L] then both terms tend to [L], so
    their difference tends to [0]. (The converse fails, e.g. the harmonic
    series.) *)
Lemma series_convergent_terms_zero (a : ℕ → ℝ) (L : ℝ)
    (Hcv : partial_sums a ⟶ L) : a ⟶ 0.
Proof.
  We need to show that ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, | a n - 0 | < ε.
  By convergent_is_cauchy it holds that partial_sums a is _Cauchy_ as (HpsC).
  Take ε > 0.
  By HpsC it holds that ∃ N2 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N2, ∀ m ≥ N2,
    | (partial_sums a) n - (partial_sums a) m | < ε.
  Obtain such a N2.
  Choose N1 := S N2. { Indeed, N1 ∈ ℕ. }
  We need to show that ∀ n ≥ N1, |a(n) - 0| < ε.
  We claim that ∀ n ∈ ℕ, (partial_sums a) (n + 1)%nat - (partial_sums a) n = a (n+1)%nat as (Hrec).
  {
    We use induction on n.
    + We first show the base case partial_sums a (0 + 1) - partial_sums a 0 = a((0 + 1)%nat).
      We need to show that (a 0%nat + a 1%nat)%R - a 0%nat = a 1%nat.
      We conclude that (a 0%nat + a 1%nat - a 0%nat) = a 1%nat.
    + We now show the induction step.
      Take n ∈ ℕ.
      Assume that partial_sums a (n + 1)%nat - partial_sums a n = a((n + 1)%nat).

      It holds that
        (partial_sums a) (S (n + 1))%nat = (partial_sums a) (n + 1)%nat + a (S (n + 1))%nat.

      It holds that S (n + 1)%nat = (n + 2)%nat.
      It holds that (n + 1 + 1)%nat = (n + 2)%nat.

      It holds that (&
        (partial_sums a) (n + 2)%nat - (partial_sums a) (n + 1)%nat
        = ((partial_sums a) (n + 1)%nat + a (n + 2)%nat) - (partial_sums a) (n + 1)%nat
        = a (n + 2)%nat
      ).

      We conclude that
        partial_sums a (n + 1 + 1) - partial_sums a (n + 1) = a((n + 1 + 1)%nat).
  }

  Take n ≥ N1.
  It holds that (n - 1)%nat ≥ N2.

  Use n := (n - 1)%nat in (Hrec). { Indeed, (n - 1)%nat ∈ ℕ. }
  It holds that partial_sums a (n - 1 + 1) - partial_sums a (n - 1) = a((n - 1 + 1)%nat).
  It holds that (n - 1 + 1)%nat = n.
  It holds that partial_sums a n - partial_sums a (n - 1)%nat = a n.

  By Hrec it holds that partial_sums a n - partial_sums a (n - 1)%nat =  a n.
  It holds that (&
      | a n - 0 |
      = | a n |
      = | partial_sums a n - partial_sums a (n - 1)%nat |
   ).
  By HpsC it holds that | partial_sums a n - partial_sums a (n - 1)%nat |  < ε.
  We conclude that | a n - 0 | < ε.

Lemma sprod_comm (a : ℕ → ℝ) (c : ℝ) :

      It holds that ∀ i ∈ ℕ, c * a i = a i * c.

(** For [|r| < 1], [∑ rᵏ = 1/(1-r)].

    Proof idea: the partial sums have the closed form
    [sₙ = (1 - r^{n+1})/(1 - r)]; since [|r| < 1] gives [r^{n+1} → 0], we get
    [sₙ → 1/(1 - r)].

    Here we obtain the closed form directly from the standard library lemma
    [GP_infinite]. *)
Lemma geometric_series (r : ℝ) (Hr : |r| < 1) :
    ∃ L : ℝ, L = 1 / (1 - r) ∧ partial_sums (fun n ↦ r ^ n) ⟶ L.
Proof.
  (* [GP_infinite] gives [Un_cv (sum_f_R0 (fun n ↦ 1 * r ^ n)) (/ (1 - r))]. *)
  By GP_infinite it holds that Pser (fun _ : ℕ ↦ 1) r (/ (1 - r)) as (Hgp).
  unfold Pser, infinite_sum in Hgp.
  We claim that partial_sums (fun n ↦ r ^ n) ⟶ (/ (1 - r)) as (Hcv).

    Take ε > 0.

    Take n ≥ n1.
    We claim that partial_sums (fun k : ℕ ↦ 1 * r ^ k) n = partial_sums (fun k : ℕ ↦ r ^ k) n as (Heq).
    {
      By sum_eq it suffices to show that ∀ i ≤ n, 1 * r ^ i = r ^ i.
      Take i ≤ n. We conclude that 1 * r ^ i = r ^ i.

    By HN it holds that Rdist (partial_sums (fun k : ℕ ↦ 1 * r ^ k) n) (/ (1 - r)) < ε.
    It holds that Rdist (partial_sums (fun k : ℕ ↦ r ^ k) n) (/ (1 - r)) < ε as (Hfin).

(** ** Telescoping series (left as an exercise in the lecture) *)

(** The partial sums of [∑ (bₖ - b_{k+1})] telescope to [b 0 - L].

    Proof idea: the partial sums telescope,
    [∑_{k=0}^n (b(k+1) - bₖ) = b(n+1) - b 0], which tends to [L - b 0].

    We prove the telescoping identity by induction and then take limits. *)
Lemma telescoping_series (b : ℕ → ℝ) (L : ℝ) (Hb : b ⟶ L) :
    ∃ ps : ℕ → ℝ, (∀ n, ps n = partial_sums (fun k ↦ b k - b (k + 1)%nat) n) ∧

Proof.
  (* The telescoping identity: sₙ = b 0 - b (n+1). *)

      We conclude that (b 0%nat - b (0 + 1)%nat) = b 0%nat - b (0 + 1)%nat.
    + We now show the induction step.
      Take n : ℕ.
      Assume that partial_sums (fun k ↦ b k - b (k + 1)%nat) n = b 0%nat - b (n + 1)%nat as (IH).
      It holds that

        = partial_sums (fun k ↦ b k - b (k + 1)%nat) n + (b (S n) - b (S n + 1)%nat) as (Hrec).

  By lim_const_seq it holds that constant_sequence (b 0%nat) ⟶ (b 0%nat) as (Hconst).
  By convergence_minus it holds that

(** ** The nth-term test for divergence *)

(** _nth-term test (divergence form)_: if [aₙ] does not converge to [0], then
    the series [∑ aₙ] diverges.

    Proof idea: the contrapositive of [series_convergent_terms_zero]. If the
    series converged its terms would tend to [0]. *)
Lemma nth_term_test_divergence (a : ℕ → ℝ) (Hnz : ¬ (a ⟶ 0)) :

Proof.
  Assume that ∃ L : ℝ, partial_sums a ⟶ L as (H).

  Contradiction.

(** ** Two classical series from Lecture 4 *)

(** _The series [∑ 1/k²] converges_.

    Proof idea (Abbott): the partial sums are increasing and bounded above,
    since [1/k² ≤ 1/(k(k-1)) = 1/(k-1) - 1/k] for [k ≥ 2], a telescoping bound
    giving [Sₙ ≤ 2]. Monotone convergence then yields a limit. (Here the terms
    are indexed as [1/(k+1)²] to match Rocq's [k : ℕ] starting at [0].) *)
Lemma sum_one_over_k_sq_converges :
    ∃ L : ℝ, partial_sums (fun k => 1 / (INR k + 1) ^ 2) ⟶ L.
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** _The harmonic series [∑ 1/k] diverges_.

    Proof idea (Abbott): grouping terms shows
    [1/3 + 1/4 > 1/2], [1/5 + ⋯ + 1/8 > 1/2], and in general each dyadic block
    contributes more than [1/2], so the partial sums are unbounded and cannot
    converge. (Terms indexed as [1/(k+1)] to match Rocq indexing.) *)
Lemma harmonic_series_diverges :
    ¬ (∃ L : ℝ, partial_sums (fun k => 1 / (INR k + 1)) ⟶ L).
Proof.
  Admitted.

(** _The p-series_: the series [∑ 1/kᵖ] converges iff [p > 1].

    Proof idea: this follows from the integral test ([integral_test], in
    [Analysis.Integration]) by comparison with [∫ 1/xᵖ dx], which is finite iff
    [p > 1]. (Terms indexed as [1/(k+1)ᵖ]; real exponentiation is [Rpower].) *)
Lemma p_series (p : ℝ) :
    (∃ L : ℝ, partial_sums (fun k => 1 / Rpower (INR k + 1) p) ⟶ L) ⇔ p > 1.
Proof.
  Admitted.
