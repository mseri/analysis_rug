(** ** Monotone convergence theorem *)

(** Monotone convergence theorem: a nondecreasing sequence bounded above
    converges, and the limit equals the supremum of its range. This is the key
    lemma enabling [Analysis.Series].

    Proof idea: by the axiom of completeness the range has a supremum [L]. Given
    [ε > 0], [L - ε] is not an upper bound, so some [a_N > L - ε]; monotonicity
    then gives [L - ε < a_N ≤ aₙ ≤ L] for all [n ≥ N], i.e. [|aₙ - L| < ε]. *)
Theorem monotone_convergence (a : ℕ → ℝ)
    (Hbdd : a is _bounded above_)
    (Hmono : ∀ n ∈ ℕ, a n ≤ a (n + 1)%nat) :
    ∃ L ∈ ℝ, a ⟶ L.
Proof.
  Define A := (fun x0 : ℝ => ∃ k : ℕ, x0 = a k).
  We claim that A is bounded from above as (HAbdd).
  {
    We need to show that ∃ M0 ∈ ℝ, M0 is an _upper bound_ for A.
    It holds that ∃ M ∈ ℝ, ∀ n ∈ ℕ, a n ≤ M.
    Obtain such an M.
    Choose (M). * Indeed, M ∈ ℝ.
    * We need to show that M is an _upper bound_ for A.
      We need to show that ∀ x ∈ A, x ≤ M.
      Take x ∈ A.
      It holds that ∃ k : ℕ, x = a k.
      Obtain such a k.
      It holds that x = a k.
      It holds that (a k ≤ M).
      We conclude that x ≤ M.
  }
  We claim that a 0%nat ∈ A as (Hnotempty).
  {
    We need to show that ∃ k : ℕ, a 0%nat = a k.
    Choose (0%nat).
    We conclude that a 0%nat = a 0%nat.
  }
  By (R_complete A (a 0%nat) Hnotempty HAbdd) it holds that
    ∃ L ∈ ℝ, L is the _supremum_ of A as (HLsup).
  Obtain such an L.
  By sup_is_upp_bd it holds that L is an _upper bound_ for A as (HLup).
  Choose (L). { Indeed, L ∈ ℝ. }
  We need to show that (* a ⟶ L. *)
      ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, | a n - L | < ε.
  Take ε > 0.
  By exists_almost_maximizer_ε it holds that
    ∃ y ∈ A, L - ε < y as (Heps).
  Obtain such a y.
  It holds that y ∈ A as (HyA).
  It holds that L - ε < y as (Hy_ineq).
  It holds that ∃ N1 : ℕ, y = a N1 as (Heq).
  Obtain such an N1.
  It holds that y = a N1 as (Heq_prop).
  Choose (N1). { Indeed, N1 ∈ ℕ. }
  We need to show that ∀ n ≥ N1, | a n - L | < ε.
  Take n ≥ N1.
  It suffices to show that -ε < a n - L < ε.
  We show both a n - L < ε and -ε < a n - L.
  - We claim that a n ∈ A as (Han).
    {
      We need to show that ∃ k : ℕ, a n = a k.
      Choose k := n.
      We conclude that a n = a k.
    }
    By HLup it holds that a n ≤ L.
    We conclude that a n - L < ε.
  - It holds that L - ε < a N1.
    By nondecr_ge it holds that a N1 ≤ a n.
    We conclude that -ε < a n - L.

(** ** Subsequences *)

(** If [a ⟶ L] and [φ] is a strictly increasing index sequence,
    then [(a ∘ φ) ⟶ L]. *)
Lemma subseq_converges (a : ℕ → ℝ) (phi : ℕ → ℕ) (L : ℝ) :
    a ⟶ L → is_index_seq phi → (fun k => a (phi k)) ⟶ L.
Proof.
  Assume that a ⟶ L as (Ha).
  Assume that is_index_seq phi as (Hphi).
  We need to show that (fun k => a (phi k)) ⟶ L.
  We need to show that
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ Nm ∈ ℕ, ∀ k ≥ Nm, | a (phi k) - L | < ε.
  Take ε > 0.
  Since (ε > 0) it holds that ∃ Nm ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ Nm, | a n - L | < ε as (HNm).
  Obtain such an Nm.
  Choose (Nm). { Indeed, Nm ∈ ℕ. }
  We need to show that ∀ k ≥ Nm, | a (phi k) - L | < ε.
  Take k ≥ Nm.
  By index_seq_grows_0 it holds that
    (phi k ≥ k)%nat.
  It holds that (phi k ≥ Nm)%nat.
  We conclude that | a (phi k) - L | < ε.
Qed.

(** ** Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem *)

(** Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem: every bounded sequence has a convergent
    subsequence.

    Proof idea: repeatedly bisect an interval containing the sequence, each time
    keeping a half that contains infinitely many terms. This produces nested
    intervals shrinking to a point [l] and a subsequence converging to [l]. *)
Theorem bolzano_weierstrass (a : ℕ → ℝ) (Hub : has_ub a) (Hlb : has_lb a) :
    ∃ phi : ℕ → ℕ, ∃ l : ℝ,
      is_index_seq phi ∧ (fun k => a (phi k)) ⟶ l.
Proof.
  (** Formalizing the proof of this one is tricky,
      I am simply relying on the one already in Waterproof. *)
  By Bolzano_Weierstrass we conclude that
    ∃ phi : ℕ → ℕ, ∃ l : ℝ,
      is_index_seq phi ∧ (fun k => a (phi k)) ⟶ l.
Qed.

(** ** Cauchy sequences *)

(** A sequence is Cauchy if its terms eventually cluster arbitrarily close. *)
Definition is_cauchy (a : ℕ → ℝ) :=
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1,
    |a n - a m| < ε.

Notation "a 'is' '_Cauchy_'" := (is_cauchy a) (at level 69).

Waterproof Register Expand "Cauchy";
  for is_cauchy;
  as "Definition Cauchy".

(** [is_cauchy] is equivalent to Stdlib's [Cauchy_crit]. *)
Lemma cauchy_crit_equiv (a : ℕ → ℝ) :
    (a is _Cauchy_) ⇔ Cauchy_crit a.
Proof.
  We show both directions.
  - We need to show that a is _Cauchy_
        ⇨ ∀ eps, eps > 0 ⇨ ∃ N, ∀ n, ∀ m, (n ≥ N)%nat ⇨ (m ≥ N)%nat ⇨ ｜a(n) - a(m)｜ < eps.
    Assume that a is _Cauchy_ as (HC).
    Take eps > 0. It holds that eps > 0 as (Heps).
    It holds that ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, |a(n) - a(m)| < eps as (H').
    Obtain such a N1. Choose (N1).
    Take n : ℕ. Take m : ℕ. 
    Assume that (n ≥ N1)%nat as (Hn) and (m ≥ N1)%nat as (Hm).
    By H' we conclude that ｜a(n) - a(m)｜ < eps.

  - We need to show that (∀ eps, eps > 0 ⇨ ∃ N, ∀ n, ∀ m,
          (n ≥ N)%nat ⇨ (m ≥ N)%nat ⇨ ｜a(n) - a(m)｜ < eps)
        ⇨ a is _Cauchy_.
    Assume that ∀ eps, eps > 0 ⇨ ∃ N, ∀ n, ∀ m,
          (n ≥ N)%nat ⇨ (m ≥ N)%nat ⇨ ｜a(n) - a(m)｜ < eps as (HC).
    We need to show that ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, |a n - a m| < ε.
    Take ε > 0.
    By HC it holds that ∃ N1, ∀ n, ∀ m, (n ≥ N1)%nat ⇨ (m ≥ N1)%nat ⇨ ｜a(n) - a(m)｜ < ε.
    Obtain such a N1.
    Choose N2 := N1%nat. { Indeed, N2 ∈ ℕ. }
    We need to show that ∀ n ≥ N2, ∀ m ≥ N2, |a(n) - a(m)| < ε.
    Take n ≥ N2. Take m ≥ N2.
    By HC we conclude that |a(n) - a(m)| < ε.
Qed.

(** Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. *)
Theorem cauchy_is_bounded (a : ℕ → ℝ) : a is _Cauchy_ → a is _bounded_.
Proof.
  Assume that a is _Cauchy_.
  It holds that
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, |a n - a m| < ε as (HC).
  We need to show that a is _bounded_.
  By is_bounded_equivalence it holds that (is_bounded a ⇔ is_bounded_equivalent a) as (Hequiv).
  By Hequiv it suffices to show that is_bounded_equivalent a.
  We need to show that
    ∃ M > 0, ∀ n ∈ ℕ, | a n | ≤ M.
  By HC it holds that
    ∃ N1 ∈ ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N1, ∀ m ≥ N1, | a n - a m | < 1.
  Obtain such a N1.

  We claim that Cauchy_crit a as (HCr).
  { apply cauchy_crit_equiv, HC. }
  
  We claim that ∃ UB : ℝ, is_upper_bound (EUn a) UB as (Hub_exists).
  {
    (** From the StdLib
        cauchy_maj: ∀ Un, Cauchy_crit(Un) ⇨ has_ub(Un)
        
        Which means that every Cauchy sequence has an upper bound.
    *)
    By cauchy_maj it holds that has_ub a.
    It holds that ∃ m, m is an _upper bound_ for EUn(a).
    Obtain such an m. Choose (m).
    We conclude that m is an _upper bound_ for EUn(a).
  }
  
  Obtain such a UB.
  It holds that (is_upper_bound (EUn a) UB) as (HUB).
  We claim that ∀ n ∈ ℕ, a n ≤ UB as (HUBn).
  {
    Take n ∈ ℕ.
    We claim that EUn a (a n) as (Heun).
    {
      We need to show that ∃ k : ℕ, a n = a k.
      Choose k := n. We conclude that a n = a k.
    }
    By HUB we conclude that a n ≤ UB.
  }

  We claim that ∃ LB : ℝ, is_upper_bound (EUn (opp_seq a)) LB.
  { 
    By cauchy_min it holds that has_lb a.
    (* By definition of has_lb a: -a has an upper bound *)
    It holds that ∃ l, l is an _upper bound_ for EUn (opp_seq a).
    Obtain such an l. Choose (l). 
    We conclude that l is an _upper bound_ for EUn (opp_seq a).
  }

  Obtain such a LB.
  It holds that
    (is_upper_bound (EUn (opp_seq a)) LB) as (HLB).
  
  We claim that ∀ n ∈ ℕ, -LB ≤ a n as (HLBn).
  {
    Take n ∈ ℕ.
    We claim that EUn (opp_seq a) (- a n).
    { 
      We need to show that
        ∃ k : ℕ, - a n = opp_seq a k.
      Choose k := n.
      We conclude that - a n = opp_seq a k.
    }
    By HLB it holds that - a n ≤ LB.
    We conclude that -LB ≤ a n.
  }

  Choose M := (Rabs UB + Rabs LB + 1). { Indeed, M > 0. }
  
  We need to show that ∀ n ∈ ℕ,
    | a n | ≤ Rabs UB + Rabs LB + 1.
  Take n ∈ ℕ.
  It holds that (a n ≤ UB).
  It holds that (-LB ≤ a n).
  By Rle_abs it holds that UB ≤ Rabs UB.
  By Rle_abs it holds that LB ≤ Rabs LB.
  By Rle_abs it holds that -LB ≤ Rabs (-LB).
  By Rabs_Ropp it holds that (Rabs (-LB) = Rabs LB).
  We conclude that | a n | ≤ Rabs UB + Rabs LB + 1.
