# Waterproof Reference Sheet

A practical guide to `coq-waterproof` (v3.x on Coq/Rocq ≥ 8.17), based on the source at [impermeable/coq-waterproof](https://github.com/impermeable/coq-waterproof) and its tutorial notebooks.

Waterproof is an Ltac2/OCaml plugin that makes Coq read like an analysis textbook. You get standard math notation (`ℝ`, `∈`, `∀`, inequality chains), mandatory goal signposts, and automation that swallows routine arithmetic. Underneath, it remains standard Coq. Raw tactics like `apply`, `destruct`, `symmetry`, and `rewrite` work whenever you want them.

---

## 1. Setup

### 1.1 Installation

Students typically use the VS Code extension ("Waterproof" on the marketplace). It bundles the plugin and renders `.mv` notebook files with collapsible hints and student input boxes.

For plain `.v` files, run `opam install coq-waterproof`.

### 1.2 Preamble

Drop this at the top of every file:

```coq
From Stdlib Require Import Rbase Rfunctions.

Require Import Waterproof.Waterproof.        (* core *)
Require Import Waterproof.Notations.Common.  (* ∀, ∃, ⇒, ∧, ∨, ¬, f(x) *)
Require Import Waterproof.Notations.Reals.   (* ℝ, ℕ, ℤ, |x|, intervals *)
Require Import Waterproof.Notations.Sets.    (* ∈, ⊂, ∩, ∪, bounded quantifiers *)
Require Import Waterproof.Chains.            (* & 0 < x ≤ 1 chains *)
Require Import Waterproof.Tactics.           (* natural-language tactics *)
Require Import Waterproof.Automation.        (* hint databases *)

Waterproof Enable Automation RealsAndIntegers.

Open Scope R_scope.
Open Scope subset_scope.
Set Default Goal Selector "!".
Set Bullet Behavior "Waterproof Relaxed Subproofs".
```

Domain libraries live under `Waterproof.Libs.*` (`Analysis`, `Reals`, `Integers`, `Sets`, `Logic`, `Negation`, `Functions`).

### 1.3 Automation datasets

`Waterproof Enable Automation <Dataset>` loads a bundle of hint databases for `We conclude that` and `It holds that`:

| Dataset | Databases loaded |
|---|---|
| `Core` | `core` |
| `Algebra` | `wp_core, arith, zarith, wp_algebra, wp_integers, wp_negation_int` |
| `Integers` | `arith, zarith, wp_core, wp_integers, wp_negation_int` |
| `RealsAndIntegers` | `arith, zarith, real, wp_core, wp_definitions, wp_alt_chars, wp_integers, wp_reals, wp_negation_reals` |
| `Sets` | `arith, zarith, wp_core, wp_integers, wp_negation_int, wp_sets` |
| `Intuition` | `wp_intuition` |
| `Empty`, `ClassicalEpsilon` | Special-purpose |

Related controls:
- `Waterproof Disable Automation X`, `Waterproof Clear Automation`, `Waterproof List Automation Databases`
- Instructors can create datasets: `Waterproof Declare Automation MySet` followed by `Waterproof Set Main Databases MySet db1, db2` (or `Decidability` / `Shorten` in place of `Main`)
- Toggles: `Waterproof Enable/Disable Automation Shield`, `Filter Errors`, `Debug Automation`, `Hypothesis Help`, `Redirect Feedback/Errors`

The automation shield is active by default. It stops automation from silently instantiating quantifiers or splitting equivalences behind your back. Students have to write those steps themselves.

## 2. Notation

### 2.1 Logic

| Waterproof | Coq | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `∀ x ..., P` / `for all x, P` | `forall` | |
| `∃ x ..., P` / `there exists x, P` | `exists` | |
| `P ⇒ Q` (also `→`, `⇨`) | `P -> Q` | `⇨` is the output form |
| `P ⇔ Q`, `↔` | `<->` | |
| `P ∧ Q`, `P ∨ Q`, `¬ P`, `x ≠ y` | `/\ , \/ , ~ , <>` | |
| `fun x ↦ t` | `fun x => t` | |
| `f(x)`, `f(x, y)` | `f x`, `f x y` | Parenthesized application |

### 2.2 Sets and bounded quantifiers (`subset_scope`)

Sets are built on `Ensemble`: `subset X` ≔ `Ensemble X`.

Set syntax: `x ∈ A`, `x ∉ A`, `A ⊂ B`, `A ∩ B`, `A ∪ B`, `A \ B`, `∅`, `Ω`, `𝒫(X)`, `{ x ∈ X | P }`, `A is empty`, `A is inhabited`, `A is disjoint from B`.

Bounded quantifiers fuse a binder with a test: `∀ x ∈ A, P`, `∃ ε > 0, P`, `∀ n ≥ N, P`, `∃ y ≠ 0, P`, and `∃! x ∈ A, P`. Recognized predicates include `∈ A`, `< y`, `≤ y`, `> y`, `≥ y`, `≠ y`. Under the hood, `∀ x > 0, P` becomes `∀ x, x > 0 ⇒ P` and `∃ x > 0, P` becomes `∃ x, x > 0 ∧ P`.

### 2.3 Numbers and analysis

`ℕ ℤ ℚ ℝ`; relations `≤ ≥`; `|x|` for `Rabs`. Intervals `[a,b]`, `[a,b)`, `(a,b]`, `(a,b)`, `[a,∞)`, `(a,∞)` live as subsets of ℝ. Limit notation: `a ⟶ c` for `converges_to`, and `Σ Cn equals x` for `infinite_sum`. Use `RealsWithSubsets` when you need ℤ or ℚ as subsets of ℝ.

### 2.4 Inequality chains

Prefix any chain with `&`:

```coq
We conclude that & 3 < 5 = 2 + 3 ≤ 6.
```

Chains turn into a conjunction of adjacent steps plus the end-to-end inequality (`3 ≤ 6`). Do not mix `<`/`≤` with `>`/`≥` in the same chain. Equality (`=`) mixes with either direction.

---

## 3. Tactics

Parenthesize any term containing spaces or operators: `(...)`. Hypotheses can be named with `as (label)`. If omitted, Waterproof assigns names like `_H`; cite unnamed hypotheses by statement using `Since (P) ...`.

### 3.1 Goals

| Sentence | What it does |
|---|---|
| `We need to show that (P).` / `To show that (P).` | Checks that the goal matches `P` (up to conversion) and reformulates the goal window. Required after case splits. |
| `We conclude that (P).` / `It follows that (P).` | Closes `P` via automation. Accepts chains: `& a ≤ b < c`. |
| `By (lemma_or_hyp) we conclude that (P).` | Closes `P`, passing automation an extra lemma or hypothesis. |
| `Since (Q) we conclude that (P).` | Same, but takes the *statement* `Q` instead of an identifier (must follow from context). |
| `It suffices to show that (P).` | Backward step: replaces current goal with `P` if automation proves `P ⇒ goal` (also `By ... it suffices ...`, `Since ... it suffices ...`). |
| `Indeed, (P).` | Discharges small side-goals, such as the membership check after `Choose`. |

### 3.2 Quantifiers

| Sentence | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Take x ∈ ℝ.` / `Take n : ℕ.` / `Take x, y : ℝ and n : ℕ.` | Introduces ∀-bound variables. Fails on ∃. Warns on variable renames. |
| `Take x : ℝ; such that (P) as (i).` | Introduces the variable and binds its bounding assumption in one step. |
| `Choose y := (2).` / `Choose (2).` | Supplies an existential witness. Bounded quantifiers leave a side-goal (`y ∈ A`, `y > 0`) that you close with `{ Indeed, ... . }`. |
| `Obtain such an n.` / `Obtain such n, m.` | Unpacks the most recently introduced ∃-hypothesis. |
| `Obtain n according to (i).` | Unpacks the ∃ from named hypothesis `(i)`. |
| `Use ε := (1/2) in (i).` | Instantiates a ∀ in hypothesis `(i)`. Bounded ∀ opens a side-condition (`1/2 > 0`) closed with `{ Indeed, ... . }`. Multiple: `Use x := a, y := b in (i).` |

### 3.3 Assumptions and forward steps

| Sentence | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Assume that (P).` / `Assume that (P) as (i).` | Introduces the antecedent of an implication or negation. Rejects statements that don't match. |
| `It holds that (P) as (i).` | Proves `P` via automation and adds it to the context. |
| `By (ref) it holds that (P).` / `Since (Q) it holds that (P).` | Adds `P` using an explicit reference or provable statement. |
| `We claim that (P) as (i).` | Asserts `P` and opens a focused subproof for you to prove manually. |
| `Define u := (t).` | Adds a local definition. |
| `Because (i) both (P) as (h1) and (Q) as (h2).` | Unpacks a conjunction `P ∧ Q` from hypothesis `(i)`. |
| `Because (i) either (P) or (Q).` | Splits on disjunction `(i)`; prove each branch under `- Case (P).` bullets. |

### 3.4 Proof structure

```coq
Either x < y or x ≥ y.            (* split on a decidable relation *)
- Case x < y.  ...
- Case x ≥ y.  ...

Either x < 0, x = 0 or x > 0.     (* three-way trichotomy *)

We show both statements.          (* goal: A ∧ B; also: We show both (A) and (B). *)
* We need to show that (A). ...
* We need to show that (B). ...

We show both directions.          (* goal: A ⇔ B *)
++ We need to show that (A ⇒ B). ...
++ We need to show that (B ⇒ A). ...

We argue by contradiction.
Assume that ¬ (P).
... Contradiction.                (* or ↯ *)

We use induction on k.
+ We first show the base case (P 0). ...
+ We now show the induction step.
  Take k ∈ ℕ. Assume that (P k). ... (* prove P (k+1) *)
```

### 3.5 Inspection and help

| Sentence | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Expand the definition of (f).` / `Expand (f).` | Prints suggested `That is, write ...` rewrites with `f` unfolded. Interactive only; delete before submitting. |
| `Expand All.` | Suggestions for all recognized definitions in the goal. Delete from final script. |
| `Help.` | Prints tactics that might make progress on the current goal. Interactive only. |

## 4. Worked example

```coq
Lemma sequence_bound :
  ∀ x ∈ ℝ, (∀ ε > 0, x < ε) ⇒ x ≤ 0.
Proof.
Take x ∈ ℝ.
Assume that ∀ ε > 0, x < ε as (i).
We argue by contradiction.
Assume that ¬ (x ≤ 0).
It holds that x > 0.
Use ε := x in (i).
{ Indeed, x > 0. }
It holds that x < x.
Contradiction.
Qed.
```

Chaining an inequality:

```coq
By f_increasing we conclude that & 2 < f(0) ≤ f(1).
```

## 5. Pitfalls and failure modes

1. **`Take` on an existential goal.** `Take` is strictly for `∀`. Use `Choose` for `∃`.
2. **Renaming binders.** If the goal says `∀ x, ...`, running `Take y : ℝ` throws a warning (*"Expected variable name x instead of y"*). In course grading, treat warnings as fatal errors. Same for `Obtain such an m` when the binder was `n`.
3. **Mismatched types in `Take`.** `Take n : bool` against `∀ n : ℕ` fails immediately. Don't supply more variables than the goal's quantifier prefix contains.
4. **Skipping side-goals on bounded quantifiers.** `Choose y := 2` on `∃ y ∈ ℝ, ...` generates a membership subproof. Close it on the spot: `{ Indeed, y ∈ ℝ. }`. Note the space before `}`. Same deal after `Use ε := 1/2 in (i)`.
5. **Drift in `Assume that`.** The text inside `Assume that (P)` must match the actual antecedent term-for-term. `Assume` also rejects goals that aren't implications or negations.
6. **Automation running out of gas.** `We conclude that` runs a depth-bounded search. When it gets stuck: add intermediate `It holds that` statements, hand it the key lemma (`By lem we conclude that ...`), or check which dataset is active. `By magic it holds that` skips the search limits, but nobody grades that kindly.
7. **The automation shield.** With the shield on, `It holds that` won't instantiate quantifiers or split iffs. You have to write `Use`, `Obtain`, `Choose`, and `We show both directions` yourself.
8. **Reusing hypothesis names.** `It holds that (P) as (h)` fails if `h` is already taken in the current context.
9. **Scope collisions with `ℕ`.** With `R_scope` open, nat arithmetic needs an explicit `%nat` annotation, as in `(k ≤ n(k))%nat`. Otherwise you get cryptic type errors on `≤` and `+`.
10. **Unparenthesized expressions.** The parser expects statements as `lconstr`. If a line throws a parse error, wrap the proposition in parens: `We conclude that (x + 3 = 3 + x).`
11. **Direction flipping in chains.** `& a < b > c` fails to parse. Split it into two statements. When you need the end-to-end inequality from a previous chain hypothesis, extract it with a separate `It holds that`.
12. **Missing case signposts.** Every bullet under `Either ... or ...` must begin with `Case (...)`. Every bullet under `We show both statements` must begin with `We need to show that (...)`. Drop them and the proof script fails.
13. **`Obtain` target confusion.** `Obtain such an n` grabs only the most recently introduced existential. If you need an older one, call `Obtain n according to (label)`.
14. **Leftover interactive commands.** `Help.` and `Expand ...` exist for interactive inspection. Delete them from submitted proofs.
15. **Grouped quantifiers in `∀` / `∃`.** The unicode notations reject multiple names in one binder block: `∀ x y : ℝ, P` and `∃ (phi : ℕ → ℕ) (x : ℝ), P` fail with *"The reference y/x was not found"*. Write `∀ x, ∀ y` or `∀ x ∈ ℝ, ∀ y ∈ ℝ, P`. (`Take x, y : ℝ` is fine—this limit applies to propositions, not tactics.)
16. **`Type`-sorted binders.** `∀ I : Type, P` chokes the unicode notation with an internal `True`/`pat` error. Fall back to ASCII `forall (I : Type), P` when quantifying over index types or sets.
17. **Variable names hijacked by the standard library.** In lines like `It holds that`, `We need to show`, or `Define`, single-letter names often resolve to Stdlib globals rather than your local binder. Common traps: `f` hits `Rtopology.f` (a family), `N` hits `BinNums.N`, `I` hits `Logic.I`, `d` hits `Sequences.d`, `d1` hits `Ranalysis1.d1`, and `E1` hits `Exp_prop.E1` (which breaks rewrites with *"Cannot find a relation to rewrite"*). Rename your parameters to `f'`, `Nn`, `Idx`, `dlt`, `Ea1` to stay out of trouble.
18. **Goal restatements after `Choose`.** After `Choose δ := ...`, a trailing bounded `∀` needs a fresh `We need to show that ∀ x ∈ ℝ, ...` before `Take x ∈ ℝ` will work.
19. **Bounded binders produce subset types.** Writing `∀ ε > 0, P` binds `ε : subset_type ℝ (> 0)`. That breaks nat arithmetic on binders (`(n + p)%nat` becomes subset addition) and prevents feeding the variable to `mkposreal`. Write `∀ n : ℕ` / `Take n : ℕ`, or expand to `∀ ε : ℝ, ε > 0 → …`.
20. **Scope leakage in lambdas.** Writing `partial_sums (fun k => 1 / (INR k + 1)) (n + p)%nat` fails with *"INR(k) has type ℝ while it is expected to have type ℕ"*. Use `(Nat.add n p)` instead.
21. **Unsupported Ltac plumbing.** Expressions like `refine (conj _ _)` and goal selectors like `split; [|split]` fail to parse. Build conjunctions by proving each piece (`By … it holds that … as (Hk)`) and finishing with `We conclude that (A ∧ B)`. `eq_sym` also fails in term position; use the `symmetry.` tactic instead.
22. **Search hangs on implicit arguments.** Calling `By … we conclude that …` with uninstantiated arguments can stall the prover for minutes. Pass arguments explicitly, or use `exact (lemma a b c H)`.
23. **Interval notation breaks pairs.** In `R_scope`, `(a, b)` and `[a, b]` represent intervals. `Choose p := (x, r)` throws *"has type ℝ ⇨ Prop"*. Wrap pair creation in a helper: `Definition idx (c r : ℝ) : ball_index := pair c r.` Same for `ℝ * ℝ`, which gets parsed as multiplication; hide it with `Definition ball_index : Type := (ℝ * ℝ)%type.`
24. **`Choose` creates a local definition.** For `∃ a ∈ A, P a`, `Choose a := t.` sets up `{ Indeed, a ∈ A. }` (or `{ We need to verify that a ∈ A. … }` — note `verify`, not `show`). The variable `a` enters the context as a let-binding, so subsequent statements must refer to `a`, not `t`.
25. **`Obtain` order with nested existentials.** `Obtain such a y` pulls from the most recent existential in the context list, not the one you wrote last in the script. For `∃ x, ∃ y, …`, restate the inner existential (`It holds that (∃ y : ℝ, …) as (Hy).`) before running the second `Obtain`.
26. **Archimedean notation syntax.** `By the Archimedean property it holds that …` cannot take an `as (label)` suffix (it is notation for `Waterproof.Libs.Reals.ArchimedN.archimedN_exists`). Label it on the next line with `It holds that … as (H).` if you need a handle.
27. **`Use` blocked during contradictions.** When the goal is "Derive a contradiction", `Use x := t in (H)` gets rejected. Restate the instance directly: `By (H) it holds that (<instance>) as (H1).`, proving the bounding condition first.

## 6. Standard library interop

Analysis proofs frequently lean on Coq's standard library. Put a temporary `Search "name".` in your file to locate lemmas. Reliable entry points: `continuity_ab_maj`/`_min` (EVT), `IVT_interv`, `Heine` + `compact_P3`, `continuity_seq`, `continuity_implies_RiemannInt`, `RiemannInt_P*`, `MVT`/`MVT_cor1`/`Rolle`, `derive_increasing_interv`, `compact_carac`.

Common friction points:

- **Divergent definitions.** Waterproof's `a ⟶ L` is `converges_to`, not Stdlib's `Un_cv`. Convert between them using `convergence_equivalence : a ⟶ q ⇔ Un_cv a q`. Similarly, Waterproof's `is_open`/`is_closed` does not match `Rtopology`'s `open_set`/`closed_set`.
- **Implicit arguments in integrals.** Most `RiemannInt_P*` lemmas keep almost everything implicit. If you hit *"has type … while it is expected to have type ℝ"*, strip the explicit `f a b` terms and pass only the proofs. Also, implicit resolution needs a named variable: `RiemannInt (RiemannInt_P14 a b M)` fails, but `pose (prc := RiemannInt_P14 a b M).` followed by `RiemannInt prc` succeeds.
- **Function algebra (`%F`).** Lemmas like `continuity_pt_plus` produce statements about `(f1 + g)%F`. That matches `fun x => f1 x + g x` definitionally, but not syntactically, so `apply` will reject it. Run `We need to show that continuity_pt (fun x => f1 x + g x) c.` first, or supply the result via `By (lemma f1 g c Hf Hg) it holds that <statement> as (H1).`
- **Sigma types.** Unpack sigma types like `{z | P z}` (from `IVT_interv`) using `destruct (…) as [z Hz].`, then split `Hz` with `It holds that`.
- **Missing arithmetic facts.** The automation has blind spots around `INR`. It does not know `INR (S n) = INR n + 1`, `INR 0 = 0`, `0 ≤ INR n`, or `1 ≤ INR n + 1`. Feed them manually: `By S_INR / pos_INR / plus_INR it holds that …`. Inverses also need help: `By Rinv_r it holds that b * / b = 1 as (Ei).` clears up stuck field identities.
- **Contradiction handling.** `Contradiction` runs automation to locate the clash automatically. To sharpen `a ≤ z` to `a < z`: run `Either a = z or a ≠ z.` and close the equality branch with `- Case (a = z). … Contradiction.`

---

## 7. Extending Waterproof

### 7.1 Hint databases

To register lemmas with the automation:

```coq
Lemma my_lemma : ∀ x ∈ ℝ, ... .
Proof. ... Qed.

#[export] Hint Resolve my_lemma : wp_reals.
```

For course assignments, isolate hints in a custom database:

```coq
Create HintDb course_db.
#[export] Hint Resolve my_lemma my_other_lemma : course_db.

Waterproof Declare Automation Course.
Waterproof Set Main Databases Course wp_core, real, wp_reals, course_db.
Waterproof Set Decidability Databases Course nocore, wp_decidability_reals.
Waterproof Set Shorten Databases Course wp_core.
Waterproof Enable Automation Course.
```

`Main` handles general closing search, `Decidability` powers `Either ... or ...`, and `Shorten` trims redundant steps in `Since`/`By`.

Stick to `Hint Resolve`. Avoid heavy `Hint Extern` hooks; automation search is depth-bounded, and bloated databases slow down every `We conclude that` across the file.

### 7.2 Registering definitions for `Expand`

```coq
Definition square (x : ℝ) := x^2.

Waterproof Register Expand "square";
  for square;
  as "Definition square".
```

Now `Expand square.` will suggest natural-language reformulations that students can click to apply in VS Code.

### 7.3 Custom notation

```coq
Notation "'max(' x , y )" := (Rmax x y) (format "'max(' x ,  y ')'").
Notation "a 'is' 'even'" := (Nat.Even a) (at level 68).
```

For predicate styles like `x is a lower bound for A`, inspect `theories/Libs/Analysis/SupAndInf.v` for precedence patterns (`is`-notations sit around level 68–70).

### 7.4 Adding tactics

Tactics live in `theories/Tactics/*.v` as Ltac2 notations over Ltac2 functions. Diagnostic messaging is handled by `theories/Util/MessagesToUser.v`. The heavy lifting (backtracking search, automation engines, unfolding) lives in OCaml under `src/`.

To add a sentence: write the Ltac2 function, bind it with `Ltac2 Notation "My" "tactic" x(lconstr) := ...`, re-export from `theories/Tactics.v`, and add test coverage to `tests/tactics/`. Build with `dune build`.

## 8. Exercise notebooks (`.mv`)

Waterproof notebooks are Markdown files with fenced Coq blocks and custom tags:

- ` ```coq ... ``` ` — Checked, read-only code.
- `<input-area> ```coq ... ``` </input-area>` — Editable student solution box.
- `<hint title="💡 Hint (click to open/close)"> ... </hint>` — Collapsible section for hints or hidden preambles.

### Course design tips

1. **Pair examples with exercises.** Provide a completed `Lemma example_...`, then give an identical structure in `Lemma exercise_...` with an empty `<input-area>`.
2. **Lock statements.** Keep `Lemma ... Proof.` and `Qed.` outside `<input-area>` so students cannot alter what they are proving.
3. **Pace sentence introduction.** Follow the canonical sequence: `We conclude that` → `We need to show that` → `Take` → `Choose`/`Indeed` → `Assume` → inequality chains → `It suffices` → `It holds` → `Use` → `Obtain` → contradiction → `Either` → `∧`/`⇔` → induction → `Expand`.
4. **Hide administrative setup.** Wrap `Waterproof Register Expand` commands and imports inside collapsible `<hint>` blocks.
5. **Autocompletion.** Remind students that Ctrl+Space / Cmd+Space displays the available sentence templates.
6. **Verify end-to-end.** Solve every input area before assigning the notebook. The concatenated file must compile cleanly with `coqc`.
